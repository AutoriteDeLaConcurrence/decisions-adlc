        "full_text_press_realease": "A number of slaughterhouses will have to be divested to maintain sufficient competition for poultry farmers. On 8 January 2021, the LDC Group notified the Autorité of its plan to acquire sole control of the Ronsard Group, previously owned by the Eureden Group. Parties to the transaction The LDC Group, which owns the Le Gaulois, Maître Coq, Marie and Loué brands, is organised around four sections: - the \"upstream\" section, which includes poultry production, cereal and agricultural supplies collection, and egg production; - the \"poultry\" section, specialising in the slaughtering and marketing of poultry and processed poultry products; - the \"catering\" section, specialising in the production and marketing of catering products; - the \"international\" section, comprising subsidiaries in Poland, Hungary and Spain. The LDC Group achieved a turnover of 4.4 billion euros. The Ronsard Group has six slaughterhouses located in Morbihan (two slaughterhouses), Ain (two slaughterhouses), Eure-et-Loir and Landes. It also markets poultry products (in particular poultry meat and processed poultry products). The Ronsard Group achieved a turnover of 170 million euros in 2019. The markets examined The parties are active at various levels of the poultry industry. Upstream, they are active as purchasers on the markets for the collection of live poultry for slaughter. Downstream, they are active as sellers on the markets for the marketing of poultry meat and processed poultry meat products. The Ronsard Group also provides live poultry slaughtering services for third parties in Morbihan, an activity that consists of a slaughterhouse slaughtering the animals that are entrusted to it by a third party and then returned to the third party, which pays a slaughtering service in return.  The Autorité has identified competition issues in the Ain and Morbihan regions On the markets for the collection of live poultry for slaughter The LDC and Ronsard Groups are both present mainly in the Ain, Morbihan and Landes regions. In the latter two départements, the transaction does not affect competition, since farmers will continue to have alternative makes to the new entity (competing slaughterhouses) for selling their production. As regards the Ain region, the transaction strengthens the position of LDC, which was already a major buyer in the area, thus depriving farmers of alternative markets in the region. On the market for the slaughter of poultry for third parties The Ronsard Group currently provides standard turkey slaughtering services in its CADF slaughterhouse in Morbihan for third-party operators, who then use the slaughtered animals and market them as fresh meat or processed products, markets in which Ronsard has little presence. However, the situation is different with regard to the LDC Group, which is present in these downstream markets for the sale of standard turkey meat and processed turkey meat products. The Autorité thus considered that, by acquiring control of the CADF slaughterhouse, LDC could hinder the access of its competitors to this slaughterhouse, to prevent them from competing with it downstream in the sales markets. On the markets for the marketing of fresh meat and processed poultry meat products. In view of the Ronsard Group's generally limited market shares in the various markets for the sale of fresh meat and processed poultry meat products, the existence of strong competing groups and the countervailing power of buyers (mass retail, out-of-home catering and the agri-food industry), the Autorité considered that the transaction was not likely to harm competition in these markets.  The proposed commitments To address the risks to competition identified by the Autorité in the markets for the collection of live poultry in Ain, the LDC Group has committed to divest the two slaughterhouses of the Ronsard Group located in Ain, thereby eliminating any overlapping activities in that département. The divestiture of one of these two slaughterhouses will be carried out under a fix-it-first mechanism, which allows the Autorité to directly approve the buyer of the divested asset as part of the clearance decision. The S2M Group, which specialises in the marketing of kosher meat, will take over the Ronsard Bresse slaughterhouse.  In Morbihan, the LDC Group has committed to not acquire or subsequently take over the CADF slaughterhouse. The Eureden Group, which until now has owned the Ronsard Group, will thus remain the owner of the CADF slaughterhouse, thereby eliminating any risk of reduced access to this slaughterhouse.  > See full text of decision 21-DCC-65 regarding the acquisition of the Ronsard Group by the LDC Volaille company What is a fix-it-first type of commitment or settlement? A fix-it-first type commitment resolves competition issues in advance. In this case, it means identifying a buyer for the assets concerned by the remedy, in this case S2M, before the Autorité's decision is adopted. The use of fix-it-first reduces the uncertainty and the time required to implement the commitment, as it eliminates the period of searching for and approving the buyer. The Autorité has already had recourse to fix-it-first commitments on four occasions: - Decision 09-DCC-67 of 23 November 2009 (LDC Volailles/Arrivé), - Decision 15-DCC-53 of 15 May 2015 (UGI/Totalgaz), - Decision 19-DCC-15 of 29 January 2019 (Dr. Oetker/Alsa), - Decision 20-DCC-72 of 26 May 2020 (Groupe Bernard Hayot/Vindémia Group) Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

Parties to the transaction The Elsan group operates around 120 private health establishments located in France, which mainly offer medical, surgical and obstetrical services as well as follow-up and rehabilitation care. Elsan also offers, to a lesser extent, comfort home hospitalisation and cosmetic surgery services. C2S is a private hospitalisation group active in France, which has 17 healthcare establishments located in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regions. These establishments mainly offer medical, surgical and obstetrical services and, to a lesser extent, after-care and rehabilitation services, home hospitalisation and cosmetic surgery. The transaction is not likely to harm competition During its analysis, the Autorité was able to re-examine and confirm its decision-making practice established in particular in its decision 20-DCC-38 regarding the exclusive control acquisition of the company Hexagone Santé Méditerranée and SCI Bonnefon- Carnot by the Elsan group. Any competitive risk could thus be ruled out concerning the markets in which the activities of the parties overlap, namely the markets for the supply of diagnostics and hospital care, the provision of infrastructure physicians necessary for their activities, follow-up and rehabilitation care, home hospitalisation and cosmetic and comfort surgery. The Autorité also ruled out any competitive risk with regard to the markets for follow-up and rehabilitation care and home hospitalisation, given the location of the parties' establishments, the presence of competitors and the applicable regulations, in particular for home hospitalisation. Considering that the transaction is not likely to harm competition, the Autorité cleared it without condition.

        "full_text_press_realease": "On 25 February 2020, the LDLC group notified the Autorité its intention to acquire the sole control of the Top Achat business capital.  Parties to the transaction The LDLC group is active in the retail of computer and electronic equipment sector through the LDLC.com, materiel.net and hardware.fr websites. It also has a network of over fifty stores under the \" LDLC.com \" banner, nine stores under the \" Materiel.net \" banner and fifteen stores under the \" Bimp \" banner. LDLC also offers computer configuration services. Top Achat is active in the online distribution of customizable computers, computer components, peripherals and accessories sector via its website topachat.com . As part of these various activities, Top Achat offers an online computer configuration service, in particular through its \" Configomatic \" tool.  Markets examined In order to analyse the impact of this takeover on competition, the Autorité de la concurrence questioned competitors of the parties to the transaction on these markets. This consultation with market operators made it possible to deepen our knowledge of the structure and functioning of these markets and to identify new markets which should be subject to a particularly careful analysis. The Autorité notably identified, for the first time in this case, two relevant markets: First of all, the market for computer components, capable itself of being segmented according to each category of components and on which it is necessary to distinguish, in the same way as for household appliances, an upstream market supply and a downstream retail market; Then, the market for computer configuration services; this corresponds to the design of custom-made computers thanks to a computer configuration tool which ensures compatibility between the various components and assembly services; these services are intended for customers wishing to design a custom-made computer, making it possible to meet their requirements in terms of technology or performance of computer equipment, like certain professionals who wish to meet a specific need (example: choice of operating system, computer performance to support professional software) or video game enthusiasts./players The Autorité also analysed the effects of this transaction on the markets for the distribution of household appliances. In these markets, the parties are simultaneously active in the upstream markets for the supply of household appliances to suppliers and in the downstream markets for the retail distribution of this type of product, which bring distributors and end consumers together. In order to fully appreciate the impacts of this transaction, the Autorité considered, for the first time, a specific segment of computer products intended for video game players. It also segmented the IT product market according to their range levels, the parties being particularly active in the high-end segment.  The transaction is not likely to harm competition At the end of its investigation, the Autorité considered that the takeover of Top Achat by the LDLC group was not likely to restrict competition in the markets for household appliances, computer components and computer configuration services. For the latter market, the Autorité noted that the transaction will allow LDLC to acquire the computer configuration tool from Top Achat. Although it enjoys a strong reputation with consumers, since it is the first tool of this type to have been developed, the new entity will continue to face significant competitors, such as Cybertek or PC Specialist. New operators are also likely to develop through marketplaces and offer an identical service to that of the new entity. The Autorité also noted that the transaction was not likely to raise competition concerns in the upstream market for the supply of computer components, given the competition from computer manufacturers and the important power of negotiation of computer component manufacturers or wholesalers active in this market. The Autorité has thus noted that the transaction does not have the effect of significantly strengthening the position of the new entity on all of these markets, in particular due to the presence of numerous other competitors and the parties' limited positions in affected markets. The Autorité therefore cleared this transaction without subjecting it to specific conditions.  These are all types of grey products suppliers such as for example Dell, Apple, etc.  Such as Fnac-Darty, Boulanger, Amazon, Cdiscount brands… Décision 20-DCC-49 du 27 mars 2020 See full text of the decision Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "On 20 March 2020, the Orpea group notified the Autorité de la concurrence of its plan to acquire sole control of the Sinoué group. Parties to the transaction The Orpea group is a multidisciplinary health group comprising nursing homes, assisted living facilities, follow-up care and rehabilitation clinics, psychiatric clinics or at home. The Sinoué group specializes in mental health (psychiatry) and follow-up care and rehabilitation. The companies involved in the transaction are simultaneously active in the psychiatry and follow-up care and rehabilitation markets. The Autorité de la concurrence examined the delimitation of the relevant markets and was therefore led to interview the actors in the concerned markets: the Agences Régionales de Santé (regional health agencies), public and private establishments including private non-profit establishments. The responses received during the investigation led to maintain the delimitation chosen by the existing practice in the follow-up care and rehabilitation market.  The specific delimitation of the market for the supply of psychiatric care in private clinics On the other hand, the specificities of the market for psychiatric care, notably due to the monopoly of public establishments in the area of ​​compulsory hospitalisation and their geographic sectorisation differing from that of private establishments, led the Autorité to consider a segmentation between the private offer and the public offer, contrary to what is chosen by the national decision-making practice for the other segments of the offer for diagnostics and hospital care market. Furthermore, the particular nature of private non-profit establishments, whose operation brings them closer to private lucrative establishments while their financing brings them close to that public establishments, has led the Autorité to consider that they must be distinguished, for the needs of this decision, of the establishments of the parties concerned. The competitive analysis of the transaction in the market for the supply of psychiatric care was thus carried out not only by taking into account the global offer, but also by taking into account the different segmentations distinguishing the public offer and the private offer, on the one hand, and distinguishing the private non-profit offer and the private lucrative offer, on the other hand.  The lack of impact of the transaction on the competition structure On the merits, the Autorité considers that the transaction will not change the competitive structure of the market segments of psychiatry and follow-up care and rehabilitation insofar as the acquisition of sole control of the Sinoué group by the Orpea group will not generate any vertical or conglomerate effect and where their combined market shares are less than 16%. Even with choosing a conservative approach which would consist in distinguishing public establishments from private establishments for the general psychiatry sector, the combined market shares will remain limited. This transaction was thus cleared without condition. Decision 20-DCC-63 of 28 April 2020 Access Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

This transaction is part of Le Groupe La Poste's strategy to diversify its activities, resulting in multiple acquisitions, which have been controlled by the Autorité de la concurrence [1] . Parties to the transaction Le Groupe La Poste is the historic operator responsible for the public postal service in France. Its activity is organised around five main business units: -Parcels & Mail Services, -GeoPost (international express delivery of parcels under 30 kg, business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C), -La Banque Postale, -La Poste Network, and -Digital Services. Économie d'Énergie (“EDE”) is active in the energy efficiency sector. Its business is to develop solutions to encourage consumers to save energy. EDE has operations in France, the UK, Spain and Italy.  Markets examined EDE is mainly active in the sectors of energy savings certificates and energy management services, especially energy brokerage. Le Groupe La Poste is not active as a provider in any of these markets. Energy Savings Certificates (“CEE” - certificats d'économie d'énergie ) were introduced by the French authorities in 2006, and are based on an obligation for energy suppliers to ensure energy savings. A multi-year target is defined and assigned to operators according to their sales volumes. At the end of the period, these suppliers must justify that they have met their targets by holding a CEE amount equivalent to these obligations. The transaction is not likely to harm competition In particular, the Autorité examined whether the acquisition of EDE by Le Groupe La Poste was likely to restrict competition on the energy savings certificates market and the energy management services market, due to conglomerate effects [2] associated with Le Groupe La Poste's unrivalled network, comprising numerous post offices, and the diversity of its activities, especially postal home delivery services. The Autorité observed that the transaction will not significantly strengthen the position of the new entity in these markets, the use of Le Groupe La Poste's network is not vital to the development of EDE's activity, and the positions of the parties in the relevant markets remain very limited. The Autorité therefore cleared the transaction without subjecting it to special conditions.  [1] For example, see Decision 17-DCC-209 of 21 December 2017 regarding the creation of a joint venture by La Poste and Suez RV France in the non-hazardous office waste collection and recovery sector, and Decision 17-DCC-74 of 1 June 2017 regarding exclusive takeover of Asten Santé by La Poste Silver in the healthcare services sector. [2] Conglomerate effects may exist when the new entity extends or strengthens its presence in markets different from those in which it operates, but the related nature of which could help it to increase its market power.  > See full text of the decision 19-DCC-195  Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

Parties to the transaction Frans Bonhomme is active in the distribution of system solutions (materials for the construction of water, sanitation, rainwater systems, etc.) and pipes for public works and construction professionals through 380 sales outlets under the Frans Bonhomme brand. DMTP, a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, operates the Point.P Travaux Publics chain, which has 58 sales outlets in France. It offers construction and public works companies solutions in the areas of sanitation and rainwater management, roads, drinking water supply, power and telephone networks, landscaping, tools as well as slab and paving work.  Frans Bonhomme has made commitments to address competition issues identified in several catchment areas The parties compete in the market to supply building materials as customers of the manufacturers of these products and in the trade in building materials for public works as suppliers to professionals. While the transaction does not raise issues with regard to competition on the markets for procurement from suppliers, the transaction would strengthen the new entity's position in several local markets for the distribution of building materials for public works. These are the catchment areas of Point.P Travaux Publics outlets located in Onet-Le-Château, Quimper and Amiens. In order to maintain competitive intensity in these areas, Frans Bonhomme undertook to divest itself of the following three outlets: the Point.P Travaux Publics store located in Onet-Le-Château; the Point.P Travaux Publics store located in Quimper; the Frans Bonhomme store located in Camon (Amiens catchment area). The divestiture of these three sales outlets to one or more competitors cleared by the Autorité de la concurrence either eliminates the business overlap resulting from the acquisition in these three areas, or reduces the new entity's market share by preserving the competitive structure of the market as it existed before the acquisition. These divestitures must be cleared by the Autorité , which will ensure that the buyers are independent of the new entity and able to stimulate competition. An independent divestiture trustee approved by the Autorité will ensure implementation of the commitments. In view of the commitments entered into by Frans Bonhomme, the Autorité today cleared the transaction. > See the full text of decision 19-DCC-221 of 27 November 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

On 25 June 2019, Mediaco Levage and Capelle Investissements notified the Autorité de la concurrence of the following three transactions: the acquisition of sole control by the Mediaco group of AltéAd and the assets of 12 companies of the AltéAd group; the acquisition of sole control by the Capelle group of AltéAd Marchal Levage, of the assets of the transport division of the AltéAd group and Infinitrans; the acquisition of joint control by the Mediaco and Capelle groups of Financière de Corton, AltéAd Management and AltéAd Industries Est. These three transactions are part of a legal proceeding opened by the tribunal de commerce de Paris on 27 May 2019 for all the companies in the AltéAd group. The Autorité granted three derogations from the suspensive effect of merger control to the Mediaco and Capelle groups on 11 July 2019 (see box below). By judgment dated 26 July 2019, the tribunal de commerce de Paris approved the disposal of these three transactions. The Autorité issues today its decision on the last two transactions (Capelle / AltéAd Marchal Levage and Mediaco-Capelle / AltéAd). The first transaction is currently being reviewed.  Parties to the transaction The Mediaco group specializes in the lifting and handling of heavy loads, in particular through a network of 70 agencies in France. It also offers industrial services and logistics services. The Capelle Group, present in France, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom, is active in specialized and abnormal transport, handling and logistics. The AltéAd group has four divisions: transport, lifting, industry (which carries out technical studies, industrial assembly, installation and equipment and machinery implementation), MTM & Solutions (which offers logistics services).  Markets examined The parties are simultaneously active in the road freight transport markets, engineering services and, in the case of the Capelle group, logistics. In this transaction, the Autorité defined two new markets within the road freight market: - The abnormal road freight transport market: movement of \"goods, machinery or vehicles of an exceptional nature because of their size or mass exceeding the statutory limits ». This market is of national dimension. - The specialized road freight transport market: this is the means used to transport atypical goods and products requiring the use of specialized tools. This mode of transport is not to be mistaken with abnormal transport, in so far as it does not specifically concern objects of exceptional mass or volume. This market is of national dimension.  In order to carry out its investigation, the Autorité de la concurrence interviewed the customers and competitors of the parties to the transaction in each of these markets. These market consultations (consultations of market operators) helped to deepen the knowledge of the structure and functioning of these markets. As the operations were not likely to harm competition, the Autorité therefore cleared them without conditions.  \t Regarding the acquisition made by Capelle \t Given the market shares of the new entity, still below 25% regardless of the retained markets and segments, the transaction was not likely to harm competition. The Autorité cleared the implementation of the transaction.  \t Regarding the joint transaction by Mediaco and Capelle \t Given the market shares of the new entity, still below 25% regardless of the retained markets and segments, the transaction was not likely to harm competition. The Autorité cleared the implementation of the transaction.  > See the full text of the decision 19-DCC-235 > See the full text of the decision 19-DCC-268 What is a derogation from the suspensive effect? If the effective conclusion of a merger is subject to approval from the Autorité de la concurrence , in certain exceptional circumstances, duly argued by the parties, the Autorité may issue a derogation enabling them to finalise part or all of the transaction without waiting for the approval decision. Although derogations from the suspensive effect are by definition exceptional, cases in which offers to take over concern companies subject to receivership or liquidation proceedings can lead to beneficial decisions. A derogation may also be justified in other exceptional circumstances, such as a risk of imminent dissolution of the acquisition target, the initiation of collective proceedings or the need for an acquiring party to provide guarantees or obtain financing to keep the target afloat. However, the issue of a derogation by the Autorité is without prejudice to the final decision made in the light of its full assessment. Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

While the operation results in no competition problem in the first sector, the Autorité has on the other hand found that it significantly strengthens the presence of the LDC group at several points along the production and marketing chain for poultry meat and poultry-based products. Eventually, the Autorité de la concurrence has authorised the operation, subject to commitments intended to remedy the identified competition problems .  LDC's commitments • On the markets for the production and marketing of fresh poultry meat  LDC and Arrivé own several poultry slaughterhouses in the West, Auvergne-Bourgogne and Southwest regions. They both market chicken, turkey, duck, guinea fowl and rabbit meat to agro-food industries, professionals in the dining-out sector (local and regional administrations, restaurants, etc.), specialty butchers and supermarkets. The acquisition of the Arrivé group significantly strengthens the LDC group's market power relative to the latter two groups of buyers, notably with regard to chicken sold under a label of quality, with LDC already owning the Loué brand and acquiring, through the Arrivé group, the Saint-Sever brand. LDC has therefore undertaken to sell the assets of the Fermiers Landais group, and therefore the Saint-Sever brand owned by the Arrivé group, so as to reduce the accumulation of market shares both with regard to the collection of poultry intended for slaughterhouses in the Southwest and the marketing of labelled poultry meat to specialty butchers and supermarkets. • On the markets for products based on poultry meat At the end of the operation, the LDC group shall have appreciably strengthened its position with all products prepared on the basis of poultry meat, notably cooked products (roasted chickens, breaded chicken, poultry snacks...). While significant competitors remain in each of these markets (Doux, Gastronome, Duc), none of them holds positions that are as strong and with such a broad assortment of products. To avoid this position in any way undermining competition relative to the sales of these products to supermarkets, the LDC group has undertaken not to grant discounts linked to the simultaneous purchase of several types of products, nor to make the referencing of one brand a condition for the referencing of another brand. > To consult the full text of decision 09-DCC-67",

Among the commitments discussed and negotiated with the Autorité de la concurrence , Numericable commits  to give competitors (internet service providers, MVNO) access to its cable network. This is the first time that a European competition authority  opens up access to cable.  In addition, Numericable must divest Outremer Telecom's mobile telephony business in La Réunion and Mayotte. > Version française  The Autorité de la concurrence gives clearance, subject to several commitments, for the exclusive acquisition of SFR (which belonged to Vivendi) by the Altice group and its subsidiary Numericable Group. THE MERGER GIVES NUMERICABLE SIGNIFICANT STANDING IN THE TELECOMS SECTOR By taking over SFR, Numericable, leader in the field of access to high-speed broadband, becomes a prominent operator in the telecoms sector. Given the market share of the new entity, this acquisition requires several remedies in order to maintain competition between the telecoms operators, for the benefit of businesses and individuals. THE STEPS IN REVIEWING THE TAKEOVER The Autorité de la concurrence was notified of the takeover on 4 June 2014 but the file was only completed on 24 June 2014. Following a first consultation of stakeholders in the market, the Autorité considered that the transaction gave rise to serious doubts regarding obstacles to competition and on 30 July 2014 started an in-depth investigation ( see press release of 30 July 2014 ). The sectoral regulators (CSA, Arcep) were also consulted. In order to dispel the competitive concerns identified, Numericable successively proposed several series of commitments which have been the subject of market tests. Following discussion and negotiation with the Autorité's members during the session of 8 October 2014 and in subsequent work meetings, substantial improvements have been achieved .  Today, Monday 27 October, the Autorité's members have met again to examine the final version of the commitments. The members consider that these commitments now meet all the concerns expressed by the Autorité and authorise the operation subject to compliance with these commitments. THE RISKS FOR COMPETITION IDENTIFIED 1. The strengthening of Numericable/SFR's position on high-speed broadband access for consumers The segment of high-speed broadband (speeds greater than 30 Mbps) is an important growth driver for operators, to the extent that it is the driving force behind subscriptions. High-speed broadband (HSB) services may be offered on the cable network or using fibre-optic. The new entity, which has an extensive cable network, will now be able to provide convergence offers combining HSB fixed and mobile (quadruple play) telecommunication services. While these offers represent an opportunity for consumers, they nevertheless tend to make it more difficult to change to another operator (lower churn rate). Thanks to its cable network, Numericable is able to offer high-speed broadband access to over 8 million homes . Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, in addition to SFR before the transaction, are investing in the deployment of optical fibre networks in order to be able to also provide HSB for their subscribers. However, the FttH deployments are still limited. Numericable enjoys a significant advance on the market and its competitors will not have an equivalent network for several years . The takeover removes SFR as a competitor for providing access to HSB and increases Numericable's subscriber base six-fold. It gives the latter the opportunity to focus its sales efforts on winning new customers and to make full use of the cable network already installed in homes, in particular by switching SFR's ADSL customers to HSB by cable. Therefore, one of the risks identified by the Autorité is that Numericable pre-empts HSB customers , at the expense of operators who have started deploying fibre. In addition, while Numericable gave its competitors access to its network before the takeover (especially Bouygues Telecom), Numericable could now be prompted to close this access in order to promote its business in the retail market. Finally, investment in fibre-optic networks is jointly funded by the various operators, including SFR. SFR in particular plays a role alongside Bouygues Telecom and Orange, with whom it shares the cost of investing in fibre in several deployment areas. The acquisition of SFR by Numericable could, if not subject to adequate safeguards, lead to the failure of these agreements, by giving the new entity an opportunity to block deployments in areas where Numericable has its cable network. 2. The reduction in the number of telecoms operators for the professional market The takeover will group together Numericable and SFR's business in the wholesale and retail markets for businesses, markets in which Numericable is operating through its subsidiary Completel. In certain geographical areas, the takeover will thus reduce the number of operators of the copper and fibre-optic networks used to devise the offers aimed at businesses from three to two, with the new entity finding itself in a duopoly with Orange. In the retail market, the acquisition could have reduced the competitive intensity and therefore the competitiveness of deals proposed to businesses. 3. A strong market share in La Réunion and Mayotte Outside mainland France, SFR and Numericable are both active in the telecommunications sector in the Indian Ocean.  With the bringing together of the businesses of SRR, SFR's subsidiary in La Réunion, and Outremer Telecom, acquired by Altice in July 2013 ('Only' brand), the operation will give Numericable very considerable market power in the area of mobile telephony in La Reunion (66% of market share) and a virtual monopoly in Mayotte (90%). Moreover, by relying on its mobile business, Numericable could expand the distribution of its internet access services by having offers combining fixed and mobile telecommunications services (triple and quadruple play), to the detriment of other operators in the Indian Ocean. 4. A risk to competition in the markets of pay television due to Vivendi's 20% stake in Numericable group's capital Once the operation has been completed, the Vivendi group will retain a minority stake in Numericable Group. This stake runs the risk of giving Vivendi extended access to strategic information of the new entity, which would enable it to adapt its competitive behaviour in some markets where it is in competition with Numericable, such as pay television and telecommunications.  Vivendi, through its subsidiary Groupe Canal Plus, could use this information to restrict competition in the publishing and pay-TV markets. Similarly, the competitive potential of the new entity in the overseas markets for the provision of internet access runs the risk of being constrained by Vivendi's ability to anticipate any sales offensive.  TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, THE AUTORITE DE LA CONCURRENCE HAS OBTAINED A SERIES OF SUBSTANTIAL, CREDIBLE AND VERIFIABLE COMMITMENTS FROM NUMERICABLE. The 4 main commitments, negotiated with the Autorité and undertaken simultaneously by Numericable and Altice, include both structural (divestures) and behavioural measures (commitments relating to the new group's behaviour). 1. Numericable commits to give competing operators access to its cable network Numericable commits to offer all operators that request it two access offers to its cable network . The first offer, in the form of a “white label” distribution agreement, will enable MVNOs that do not have their own set-up boxes to market cable retail services. The second, so-called “bitstream” offer, will enable ISPs to use access to the cable network to market their very high speed services, using their own set-up boxes and their own customer platforms. These offers, which will be subject to prior approval by the Autorité , aim to allow Numericable's competitors to replicate its retail services within a very short period of time, without having to wait for fibre optic network deployments to be completed. These operators will therefore be able to compete effectively with Altice's subsidiary, by providing their own very high speed fixed telecom services using the cable network. This commitment is planned on a provisional basis, during the time necessary for the competitors to deploy their own fibre optic networks . By placing competitors on equal footing, the Autorité will be able to prevent Numericable from capturing the greatest proportion of very high speed internet customers.  The commitments negotiated also ensure that Numericable will be unable to use the contracts entered into prior to the operation by SFR with Bouygues Telecom and Orange in order to block the deployment and operation of these operators' fibre optic networks. In practical terms, Numericable has therefore committed to connect buildings to the fibre optic network deployed by SFR and Bouygues Telecom within the context of their agreement, in order to enable Bouygues Telecom to operate its network . These connections will be completed within the time periods established in the commitments. Furthermore, following a negotiation period aiming to modify the deployment areas covered by the agreement entered into between SFR and Orange, Numericable commits not to prevent Orange from deploying its own fibre optic network in the areas previously reserved for SFR . Thus, neither Bouygues Telecom nor Orange will be constrained by Numericable in the deployment or operation of their own fibre optic networks. 2. Numericable must divest Completel's copper network, an operator for professionals Numericable has undertaken commitments for the two kinds of access sold on the fixed telecommunications market for business clients. Firstly, for access to the copper network (“DSL”), Numericable has committed to divesting itself of Completel's DSL network to an operator capable of driving competition on the market.  Secondly, Numericable will provide retail market operators for business clients with access to its fibre optic local loops, through a wholesale offer valid on all of the SFR and Completel networks. 3. Numericable must divest Outremer Telecom These assets include Outremer Telecom's activities on the mobile telephone retail market and all of Outremer Telecom's retail outlets. This commitment will ensure that a new competitor will emerge on the mobile telephony markets and ensure that effective competition is maintained. The commitment thus enables a constant number of mobile operators to be maintained in these territories for the benefit of consumers (price, variety of offers). 4. The new group must take measures in order that no strategic information is provided to Vivendi This confidentiality obligation applies, in particular, to information concerning (i) pay TV markets (transfer of channels by editors to telecom operators for the creation of multichannel packages), (ii) downstream pay TV service distribution markets and (iii) overseas telecommunications markets. It will be monitored by a trusted third party, which will take part in the Numericable Group's Board and audit committee meetings in order to ensure that no sensitive information is exchanged. These commitments will be undertaken for a period of 5 years, renewable once. Their implementation will be monitored by an independent trustee who will be named after the Autorité de la concurrence's agreement. The Autorité will be mindful that the required divestments be implemented in a transparent manner and that they will guarantee that a genuinely competitive environment is maintained on the markets concerned. > The full text of the decision will shortly be published on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence ( www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr ) Press contact: Ingalill d'Armaillé : + 33 1 55 04 01 82 / Mel",

The parties are active mainly in the markets of spirit production (whiskey, vodka, gin, port, tequila, cocktails, etc.), of wines and non-alcoholic drinks for on-trade distribution networks (coffees, hotels, restaurants, wholesalers, “cash and carry”, wine cellar …) and mass retail.  If Cofepp markets its products under manufacturer-brands (hereafter “MDF') and supplies supermarkets with retailers' brands (hereafter “MDD”), MBWS almost exclusively markets its spirits under MDF label.  After ruling out any competition issue, in almost every beverage market concerned by the transaction in which the two groups are simultaneously active, the Autorité de la concurrence established that the transaction leads to quasi-monopolistic positions in the markets of tequila and port production, and to strong positions in the production of vodka and whiskey, intended to be marketed in supermarkets in France. Regarding the vodka and whiskey markets, the Autorité considered that the transaction was not likely to harm competition considering the existence of alternatives for consumers.  The new entity will own the brands Poliakov and Sobieski in the vodka market and Label 5, Sir Edward's and William Peel brands in the whiskey market. The Autorité considered that it was not excluded that the new entity would intend to increase the price of a brand in each market (Sobieski and / or William Peel), since part of the consumers could move towards other brands. But in these two markets, the Autorité de la concurrence found that even though this strategy could be beneficial to the new identity, it would remain confronted in each of these markets to the competition on the one hand of mass retail - via its retailer's brands -, and on the other hand of several global actors, which provide alternatives to consumers, such as Diageo (Smirnoff), William Grant & Sons (Zubrowka Biala, Grant's), Bacardi Martini (Eristoff, William Lawson's) and Pernod Ricard (Long John). All of these actors furthermore implement effective commercial strategies, particularly with product discounts, which are also likely to deter the new entity from raising its prices.  Finally, the Autorité de la concurrence considered that the mass retail sector has a significant counter-power, likely to counterbalance the important positions held by the new entity in order to maintain a sufficient competitive pressure on retail price to consumers. Given the quasi-monopoly situation of the new identity in the port and tequila markets, it will have to divest of the port brand Pitters and the tequila brand Tiscaz.  In the port and tequila markets, Cofepp would have held, following the transaction, a quasi-monopolistic position. In order to remedy any competition issue that might arise from the transaction, Cofepp submitted structural commitments in each of these markets. The operation has therefore been cleared subject to the sale of the Pitters (now owned by MBWS) and Tiscaz (now owned by Cofepp) brands to one or several independent operators, authorized by the Autorité de la concurrence. These divestments are intended to maintain competition in the port and tequila markets. They will ensure the mass retail sector and consumers alike are offered a large range of products and prices. > The full text of the decision 19-DCC-36 of 28 February 2019 . > Press contacts: Bertille Gauthier +33 1 55 04 00 39 / Email Chloé Duretête + 33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background On 19 June 2019, Fnac Darty notified the Autorité de la concurrence of its intention to acquire Nature & Découvertes. At the end of its competitive analysis, the Autorité identified that the acquisition would not harm competition and cleared the transaction. Parties to the transaction Fnac Darty sells products and services to consumers through its two main brands, Fnac and Darty. The Fnac brand is active in the distribution of editorial products (music, video, books and board games) and electronic (photography, video-TV, sound, microcomputers, video games and consoles), ticketing, children's toys (\"Fnac Kids\" areas), high-end small electrical household appliances, stationery, telephony and connected objects. These products are distributed through more than 150 franchised or integrated stores in France. The Darty brand, through more than 200 stores, integrated or franchised, is active in the distribution of white goods (large and small appliances), gray goods (communication and multimedia), brown goods (TVs and sound) as well as custom fitted kitchens. Fnac Darty also distributes these products and services via the www.fnac.com, www.darty.com and www.mistergooddeal.com websites, which also include marketplaces. Nature & Découvertes operates a distribution network of natural and well-being products through 81 stores in mainland France, and four franchised stores in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany. It also owns the website www.natureetdecouvertes.com. Nature & Découvertes distributes mainly wellness and leisure products, books, food products, games and toys, and stationery. Nature & Découvertes also controls the company Terre d'OC Evolution, a manufacturer of tea and cosmetics. Brands are both present in stores and online sale of books and toys As mentioned above, Nature & Découvertes distributes products related to well-being and nature, a non-replicated concept to this day by another national brand. Fnac Darty does not therefore appear, in the first analysis, as a close competitor of Nature & Découvertes. However, overlaps of activity between the parties have been identified on the basis of an analysis by product range: in fact, Fnac Darty and Nature & Découvertes both distribute, in stores and on their e-commerce sites, books and toys. The Autorité de la concurrence was able to rule out any risk of harming competition in the book and toy retail markets in all catchment areas where Nature & Découvertes' stores are located. Regarding the retail sale of books, the Autorité first found that there was a retail book market, including in-store sales and online sales. In this market, examined at the national level, but also at the local level, in catchment areas defined around Nature & Découvertes stores, the Autorité found that the new entity's market shares will be limited in most areas. If in some areas the number of competing stores selling books is very small, consumers will still benefit from a choice in the book offer, especially from online retailers, foremost among which are Amazon, which represent credible alternatives for the consumer. The Autorité has also taken into account the fact that Nature & Découvertes, which also has very limited positions, is not a close competitor of the Fnac brand in the book retail markets. The Fnac brand is in fact mainly in competition with other cultural superstores (such as Cultura, Furet du Nord or Espace Culturels E. Leclerc) and online sales specialists, such as Amazon. With regard to the retail distribution of toys, the combined market shares of the parties remain limited in all areas of overlapping activity, with the new entity still facing competition from many stores and online specialized retailers. The transaction is also not likely to significantly strengthen the bargaining power of the new entity with shopping center managers. Fnac Darty and Nature & Découvertes operate stores located in shopping centers. For the first time, the Autorité de la concurrence focused on the risk of exclusion of current or potential competitors, who are present in shopping centers. Indeed, Fnac Darty's increased bargaining power vis-à-vis shopping center managers could have enabled it to obtain more favorable contractual terms for its stores or more unfavorable for its competitors, or to prevent the arrival of a new competitor. After questioning the main shopping center managers in France, the Autorité concluded that the new entity would not have sufficient bargaining power to implement such an exclusion strategy. At the end of its investigation, the Autorité cleared the transaction without conditions. 19-DCC-132 regarding the sole control acquisition of Nature & Découvertes company by Fnac … Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The companies involved in the transaction The buyers The group Galeries Lafayette is a retailer in the fashion, luxury, beauty, leisure and home sectors in France. It operates the Galeries Lafayette and BHV/Marais department stores as well as specialised jewellery and watch brands Louis Pion, Guérin Joaillerie, Galeries Lafayette-Royal Quartz Paris. Lastly, Galeries Lafayette also operates Mille et Une Listes, Eataly Paris Marais, Bazarchic and La Redoute. Galeries Lafayette Group also offers tour operator and travel agency services through Galeries Lafayette Voyages. CFN is a holding company, controlled by Mr. Alain Nemarq, current President and CEO of Mauboussin. The companies acquired Mauboussin is specialised in the retail distribution of jewellery and high-end jewellery and, secondarily, of watches, perfumes, leather goods and glasses. It operates a network of 55 stores, 22 counters, 4 shops-in-shop and an online store, mauboussin.fr. Guérin Joaillerie also specialises in the retail distribution of jewellery across 21 stores and 18 counters within Galeries Lafayette group's stores and its online store guerin.com. The investigation carried out by the Autorité de la concurrence ruled out any competition concerns  The business activities of the parties are in direct competition mainly in the markets of retail distribution of watches, jewellery and goldsmithery products in 44 catchment areas. The analysis of the transaction has, however, ruled out any competition concerns. This is because, in these catchment areas, the jewellery stores held by the new entity will ultimately be few and will have to face many competitors: large groups of specialised national retailers, notably the brands owned by group Thom Europe (“Marc Orian”, “Histoire d'Or”, “J'M”, “Trésor”) and by Synalia (“Julien d'Orcel”, “Guilde des Orfèvres”, “Mégalithes”), as well as numerous local jewellers.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Agricultural and agrifood cooperative groups D'Aucy and Triskalia notified the Autorité de la concurrence of their planned merger. The Autorité identified a number of risks of significant harm to competition in the markets for the collection of cereals, oilseeds and protein crops, agricultural supplies and retail distribution of gardening, DIY, outdoor amenities and pet shop. In response to these competition concerns, the parties presented commitments covering the different aspects. They committed themselves to divest of 20 cereal, protein and oilseed crop collection infrastructures and 6 sales outlets operated until now by D'Aucy and Triskalia under the brands Gamm vert and Point vert. They also committed to amend their articles of association to give agricultural holdings more freedom in terms of the volume of cereals they must contribute to the cooperative and agricultural supplies they must buy from it (that is to say seeds, phytosanitary products, fertilizers and amendments, but also agricultural equipment and veterinary products).  Parties to the transaction D'Aucy and Triskalia are two large, diversified cooperative groups, whose turnover is respectively €1.2 billion and €1.9 billion and are notably active in the collection and marketing of cereals, protein and oilseed crops, seed, agricultural supplies, animal nutrition, vegetables, eggs and egg products, catering products, retail distribution of gardening, DIY, landscaping and pet products and fuel oil distribution.  Competition concerns identified Although the transaction does not raise any competition concerns in the seed, animal nutrition, vegetables, eggs and egg products sectors, the Autorité de la concurrence considered that there were risks of significant anticompetitive effects in the cereal, protein and oilseed crop collection, agricultural supplies and retail distribution of gardening, DIY, landscaping and pet products sectors. Indeed, in the sector of grains, proteins and oilseeds, the market share of the new entity exceeded 70% in certain collection areas; similarly, in the retail sector of gardening, DIY, outdoor and pet foods, the market share of the new entity reached 100% in certain catchment areas. Thus, in view of the new entity's large market share in these sectors, there were risks of price increases or of reductions in product quality and diversity.  Commitments In response to these competition concerns, the parties made a commitment to divest themselves of 20 collection infrastructures and 6 sales outlets operated until now by D'Aucy and Triskalia under the brands Gamm vert and Point vert. They also made a commitment to change the contribution and procurement obligations imposed on agricultural holdings. Divestiture of 20 collection platforms and silos In the upstream cereal, protein and oilseed crop collection market, Triskalia and D'Aucy have made a commitment to divest themselves of the 20 collection platforms and silos situated in the areas where the transaction would have anticompetitive effects. The farmers in these areas will thus have an alternative for stocking and selling their production.  Greater room for manoeuvre for agricultural holdings in terms of contributions and procurement The parties also made a commitment that their future articles of association would reduce the cereal, protein and oilseed crop contribution obligation placed on their members to bring it to at least 55% of their production, compared to 100% at present. In addition, the parties made a commitment not to link their members' cereal, protein and oilseed crop contribution to the procurement of agricultural supplies. In the agricultural supplies market , the parties also made a commitment that their future articles of association would reduce the obligation on their members to purchase at least 55% of their agricultural supplies from them. As for collection, the parties made a commitment not to include any clause or impose any obligation on their members designed to circumvent the above commitment, in their articles of association or in any other document governing their relations with their members. These commitments are intended to ensure that adequate competition is maintained in the affected areas.  Divestiture of 6 sales outlets operated until now by D'Aucy and Triskalia under the brands Gamm vert and Point vert In the downstream gardening, DIY, landscaping and pet product retail distribution market , the parties made a commitment to divest themselves of six sales outlets operated until now by D'Aucy and Triskalia under the brands Gamm vert and Point vert in the Bréhan (56), Broons (35), Caulnes (22), Guéméné (56), Le Faouët (56) and Malansac (56) areas to competing operators approved by the Autorité de la concurrence . Consumers will thus benefit from a choice of competing retailers and therefore the maintenance of diversity in terms of prices and services when buying gardening and pet products.  The divestitures mean that stores will change retailer rather than close The divestitures, which are subject to commitments, are justified by the disappearance of local competitive pressure on the new entity after the transaction. Regarding the market for the retail distribution of gardening, DIY, landscaping and animal products, the objective of divestiture commitments is to enable the stores and their activities to be taken over by a competitor of the new entity, in order to maintain dynamic competition in the affected catchment area and ensure that consumers have continued access to a diversified choice of DIY, home decoration and gardening products. Regarding the markets of cereal, protein and oilseed crop collection, the same approach guided the conditions related to the divestiture of the silos and platforms by the operators. >  See f ull text of decision 19-DCC-147 of 24 July 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Press group Reworld Media notified the Autorité of its planned acquisition of publisher Mondadori France. Concluding its analysis, the  Autorité identified competition concerns in the car magazines market, in which the new entity would own three of the four leading titles distributed in France. Reworld Media responded to these concerns by making a commitment to sell one car magazine title to a competitor to maintain sufficient competition in this market. The Autorité therefore decided to clear the transaction subject to the condition that one car magazine title be sold. Parties to the transaction Reworld Media is a French group whose main activities are print magazine publication, editorial website operation, the selling of advertising space in these media, and online advertising intermediation. It publishes many magazines, including Marie France, Maison & Travaux, Télé Magazine, Disney Fun, J'apprends à and  Auto Moto . The activities of Mondadori France include print magazine publication, editorial website operation and the selling of advertising space in these media. It publishes many magazines, including  Biba, Grazia, Modes & Travaux, Top Santé, L'Ami des Jardins, Closer, Le Chasseur Français, Diapason, Science & Vie, Télé Star, Télé Poche, Auto Plus  and  L'Auto-Journal . Mondadori France is indirectly controlled by the Berlusconi family. The new entity would have owned three of the four car magazine titles with the largest circulation in France The transaction does not raise any competition concerns regarding the markets in the selling of magazine advertising space because of the competitive pressure exerted by the Internet, and the advertisers' strong countervailing power, particularly in the automotive sector. Nor does it raise any competition concerns regarding the editorial website operation markets, in which the new entity would have a limited position. However, the  Autorité  considered that there were competition concerns in the general interest car magazines market. As a result of the transaction, Reworld Media would hold a very large market share in the general interest car magazines market, publishing three of the four titles with the largest circulation in France: Auto Moto, Auto Plus and L'Auto-Journal . According to the Autorité 's analysis, the only credible alternative to the new entity's magazines in this market would have been L'Automobile Magazine , published by Upside Down Media. The  Autorité considered that strengthening Reworld Media in this market was therefore likely to result in an increase in its magazines' unit selling price or subscription cost or a deterioration in their content quality. The Autorité also noted that the readers of these magazines would be deprived of an independent offering in an already concentrated market. To guarantee pluralism in the car magazines market, Reworld must sell one title, either L'Auto Journal or Auto-Moto, to a competitor. To remedy the doubts expressed by the Autorité , Reworld Media has made a commitment to sell either L'Auto Journal or Auto-Moto to a competitor to be approved by the  Autorité in the next few months. This commitment is likely to reduce Reworld Media's market power and to guarantee the maintenance of sufficient competition and plurality in the editorial offerings available to readers of general interest car magazines in France. The Autorité has therefore cleared the transaction subject to this condition. Past transactions in the press sector The Autorité de la concurrence  has had to rule on mergers in the press sector on several occasions. For example, it examined: - the acquisition of the Est Républicain group by Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel; - the acquisition of Le Parisien and Aujourd'hui en France by LVMH; - the acquisitions of Le Monde and Le Nouvel Observateur by Messrs. Bergé, Niel and Pigasse. In all its decisions, the Autorité de la concurrence examined the effects of these acquisitions on competition and particularly on consumer well-being, placing conditions on these transactions where necessary to avoid homogenisation of the titles' content and ensure editorial quality and diversity are maintained for their readers. The decision is the first since 2009 in which an acquisition has been made subject to an obligation to sell a press title. Decision 19-DCC-141 of 24 July 2019 See full text of the decision",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Following a referral decision by the European Commission, TF1, France Télévisions and Métropole Télévision (hereinafter referred to as M6) notified to the Autorité de la concurrence to the contemplated creation of a joint venture, Salto, on 17 June 2019. After a thorough and detailed investigation, enlightened by the opinion issued by the CSA, the Autorité clears the creation of this joint venture, subject to conditions. While the transaction is significant, a sustained dialogue with all stakeholders resulted in its clearance in Phase 1 within eight weeks, once the proposed commitments removed all identified competition concerns. Salto will distribute television services, including the digital terrestrial television (DTT) channels of the parent companies and their associated services and functionalities (e. g. catch-up television) and subscription video-on-demand (SVOD). Salto's offering will be streamed over the top (OTT) and therefore be accessible to consumers directly on the Internet without the intermediary of a distributor. As part of the procedure, the parties submitted commitments upon filing the notification form in order to address the competition concerns raised by the transaction. As a result, the Autorité was able to quickly consult the market on this initial proposal. Market stakeholders's responses to the market testcontributed to exchanges with the notifying parties. These discussions led them to propose a substantially improved new version of their proposed commitments, which in turn was market tested prior to final amendments which were considered satisfactory by the Autorité. After examining the possible effects of the transaction on the various markets concerned, the Autorité cleared the transaction subject to commitments (as proposed in their final version on 31 July 2019). These commitments aim to prevent coordination risks between TF1, France Télévisions and M6, as well as risks identified concerning: - the upstream market for the acquisition of broadcasting rights - the market for editing and marketing television channels - the market for the distribution of pay TV services - advertising markets UNDERTAKEN COMMITMENTS  1. UPSTREAM MARKETS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BROADCASTING RIGHTS FOR AUDIOVISUAL CONTENT In order to replenish the catalogue of its SVOD platform, Salto will be active in the markets for the acquisition of broadcasting rights for audiovisual content (cinematographic and audiovisual works and flow programmes). In line with its Opinion 19-A-04, the Autorité has, for the first time, considered the existence of a single market for the acquisition of linear and non-linear broadcasting rights (except for recent films). The Autorité analysed to what extent TF1, France Télévisions and M6 are likely to use their position on the markets for the acquisition of linear broadcasting rights in order to restrict the access of Salto's competitors to non-linear broadcasting rights and to favour Salto in this respect. This risk has been eliminated with regard to American and European contents, in particular because of the presence of significant competitors. On the other hand, as regards original French-language content and flow programmes, the Autorité identified a risk that the parent companies may implement a generalised strategy of coupling their purchases of linear and non-linear broadcasting rights in order to promote Salto's access to non-linear broadcasting rights , a strategy which would have been harmful both to Salto's competitors and to copyright holders. It also found that the contracts for the purchase of linear broadcasting rights concluded by TF1, France Télévisions and M6 included contractual clauses likely to make the purchase of non-linear broadcasting rights by Salto's competitors more complex (holdback clauses, priority and pre-emption rights).  To address these competitive risks, TF1, France Télévisions and M6 have undertaken to limit their possibilities for joint purchases of linear and non-linear broadcasting rights. In addition, the supply conditions by which Salto will acquire contents from its parent companies will be regulated in several ways so that Salto's ability to acquire exclusive contents from its parent companies will be limited. In addition, Salto's possibilities to benefit from the contractual clauses contained in the contracts for the purchase of linear broadcasting rights concluded by TF1, France Télévisions and M6 will be strictly regulated. 2.  INTERMEDIATE MARKETS FOR EDITING AND MARKETING TELEVISION CHANNELS As part of its activity as a distributor of television programming, Salto will enter into distribution contracts with channel operators. Following its analysis, the Autorité ruled out any problems concerning pay TV channels given TF1's and M6's weak position in this market. Taking into account recent market developments, the Autorité for the first time considered a market for the editing and marketing of free-to-air DTT channels. It found that the channels operated by TF1, France Télévisions and M6, as well as their associated services and functionalities, were essential to enable television distributors to provide an attractive offering to consumers. However, the Autorité considered that, following the launch of Salto, the parent companies could have the ability and incentive to prevent Salto's competing distributors from accessing, at least in part, their channels and associated services and features. In order to resolve these competition concerns, TF1, France Télévisions and M6 have undertaken that Salto will not be able to enter into exclusive distribution agreements for free-to-air DTT channels and their associated services and features. This lack of exclusivity applies particularly to the channels of free-to-air DTT of its parent companies and their services and associated functionalities but also to those of third party operators. However, in order to maintain Salto's incentives to innovate and differentiate itself, the commitments provide for the possibility for Salto to benefit from temporary exclusivity for services and functionalities of its own initiative. TF1, France Télévisions and M6 have also undertaken to offer directly, i.e., without the intermediary of Salto, the distribution of their free-to-air DTT channels along with their associated services and functionalities to any third party distributor on objective and non-discriminatory terms. To this end, the commitments provide in particular for a mechanism for setting the remuneration due by Salto to its parent companies by two independent experts.  3.  DOWNSTREAM MARKETS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAY TV SERVICES In view of the proximity of the business activities of TF1, France Télévisions and M6 in providing television services and Salto's activities in the field of distribution, the Autorité considered that there was a risk of cross-promotion between the free-to-air DTT channels of TF1, France Télévisions and M6 and the Salto platform.  The parties have therefore undertaken to limit the possibilities of cross-promotion between their channels and the Salto platform. In other respects, Salto will be a new entrant in the market for the distribution of pay TV services and will face significant competition, in particular from SVOD platforms and Internet service providers. Under these circumstances, the Autorité ruled out any competition concerns in the market for the distribution of pay TV services and therefore considered that no commitments in this respect were required.  4.  ADVERTISING MARKETS Salto will not sell advertising space. The Autorité has therefore ruled out any horizontal risks associated with the transaction on these markets. On the other hand, Salto will likely buy advertising space from its parent companies. As such: The parent companies have undertaken to market advertising space to Salto on the basis of general terms and conditions of sale, and under objective and non-discriminatory conditions.  5.  COORDINATION RISKS BETWEEN TF1, FRANCE TÉLÉVISIONS, M6 AND SALTO In view of the links created by the transaction, the Autorité considered that it is likely to increase transparency between the parent companies and/or Salto on the markets for the acquisition of broadcasting rights for audiovisual content and for editing and marketing of free-to-air DTT channels, and to a lesser extent, pay TV channels. Such transparency is likely to facilitate coordination between TF1, France Télévisions and M6, as well as with their joint subsidiary. In order to meet this competition concern, the parent companies have undertaken to put in place a set of individual and collective guarantees designed to limit the exchange of information between Salto and its parent companies to what is strictly necessary and within a precise framework. Conditions for implementing the commitments The commitments proposed by the parties will apply throughout mainland France and in French overseas departments, regions and collectivities. With the exception of commitments to prevent any risk of coordination, which will apply for the lifetime of Salto, the remedies will apply for a period of five years from the date of the decision. At the end of this period, they may be renewed for a maximum period of five years following a competitive analysis to be conducted by the Autorité.

By a decision issued today, the Autorité clears the transaction without any special conditions. Parties to the transaction Ineos is a diversified global group active in the manufacture of petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and petroleum products and in oil and gas exploration and production. In 2017, Ineos acquired FC Lausanne-Sport, the main football club in the city of Lausanne, playing in the Swiss second division. SASP Olympique Gymnaste Club de Nice Côte d'Azur is a professional sports company created by the OGC Nice Côte d'Azur Association to manage all activities related to the participation of the OGC Nice professional football club in paid sports events (League 1/League 2 championship, national cups and, in case of qualification, European competitions). First transaction involving a professional football club examined by the Autorité This is the first time that the Autorité has examined a transaction in the football club sector. The European Commission also has not had the opportunity to examine such a transaction from a competition law perspective. The Autorité has therefore focused on identifying the relevant markets in which football clubs operate in France. The Autorité has focused in particular on the market for the transfer of professional players, which had never before been defined by decision-making practice. Following the investigation, it considers that there is a sizeable market, at least European and even international, in which the various professional football clubs compete to attract the best players. Professional players made their determination in this regard on the basis of (i) net remuneration, (ii) club reputation, (iii) the duration of the contract, (iv) the competitiveness of the national championship and (v) the international competitions in which the club participates. The Autorité has also taken into consideration the sports marketing market, which is increasingly international in scope. The Autorité found that after the transaction the new entity will have only a very limited position in the various sectors of activity of professional football clubs, and in particular in the market for the transfer of professional players, and therefore cleared the acquisition without any specific conditions. > See full text of the decision 19-DCC-160 of 21 August 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The group De Fursac is also active in France and Switzerland in the design, manufacture and retail of ready-to-wear clothing, shoes and accessories for men.  The transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité reviewed whether the acquisition of the brand De Fursac by a group that already owns well-known ready-to-wear clothing brands is likely to restrict competition in the men's clothing and footwear retail markets, particularly in the catchment areas in which the parties' stores are located. It found that, in each of these areas, consumers will continue to benefit from alternative offers to those of the parties' brands that are equivalent in terms of price and market positioning. There are a sufficient number of these competing stores to prevent the new entity from being encouraged to raise the price of items sold or to reduce the quality of the services provided in its stores.

On 8 August 2019, Cellnex notified the Autorité of its plan to acquire control of Iliad 7. This transaction is part of the Cellnex group's acquisition of telecommunications infrastructure hosting activities for the Iliad Group in Italy and its key shareholder in Switzerland. Galata, a subsidiary of Cellnex Telecom, has signed an agreement for the acquisition of 2,200 mobile telecommunication sites in Italy and Swiss Towers, a subsidiary of Cellnex Telecom, has signed an agreement to acquire 2,800 mobile telecommunication sites in Switzerland. By a decision issued on 30 August 2019, the Autorité clears the acquisition of Iliad 7 by Cellnex without any special conditions. Parties to the transaction Cellnex is a Spanish group, active in particular in the mobile telecommunications sector in Switzerland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom. In France, Cellnex operates approximately 3,000 mobile telecommunications sites. Iliad 7 is a subsidiary of the Iliad group, which will operate approximately 5,700 mobile telecommunications sites in France. This subsidiary will manage the towers, masts, network's technical equipment rooms of Free's mobile telecommunications.  Market examination Cellnex and Iliad 7 operate mobile telecommunications sites in France which they lease to mobile network operators (MNOs). A mobile telecommunications site consists of “passive” infrastructure, generally composed of a tower or mast, a technical room and the technical equipment necessary for operation, and “active” infrastructure for broadcasting radio waves which remains the property of MNOs. The passive infrastructure is installed on a plot of land, a roof deck or a high point on which the operator of the equipment has a right of occupancy. The Autorité has not identified any competition concerns that may arise as a result of the transaction The Autorité considered that Cellnex's acquisition of Iliad 7 is not likely to affect competition in the market for hosting mobile telephony equipment in France. Among other aspects, the Autorité examined whether the acquisition of sites previously owned by an MNO (in this case Iliad/Free) by a company that already owns such sites was likely to restrict competition in the market for hosting mobile telephony infrastructure. In particular, it examined the effects of the transaction on the supply of sites on roof decks in urban areas where the parties' combined position is highest, but does not exceed 40%. Given the existence of credible, current (including SFR's subsidiary Hivory and TDF) and potential alternatives, Cellnex will not have any incentive to increase hosting prices or degrade the quality of services provided to MNOs following the transaction. The Autorité therefore cleared the acquisition without subjecting it to any particular conditions. > See the full text of decision 19-DCC-169 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

By a decision issued today, the Autorité clears the transaction without conditions. Parties to the transaction Colgate-Palmolive is an American company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It is active in the markets for the manufacture and marketing of oral hygiene products (Colgate and Elmex), personal hygiene products (Palmolive, Sanex and Tahiti), household cleaning products (Ajax, Paic and Soupline) and pet food (Hill's). Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques specialises in “anti-ageing” cosmetic products for the general public, which it markets under the Filorga brand. A French laboratory of aesthetic medicine founded in 1978 by M. Tordjman, it distributes about fifty products (skin care, sunscreen, make-up, etc.) in some sixty countries. Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques had a turnover of 180million euros in 2018. On 11 July 2019, Colgate Palmolive announced the acquisition of Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques for 1,5 billion euros.  The transaction is not likely to harm competition In particular, the Autorité examined whether the acquisition of Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques by an international group active in many markets with strong brands was likely to restrict competition in the markets for cosmetics and perfumes. It found that the transaction does not strengthen Colgate-Palmolive's position in these markets, as the distribution networks for the products manufactured by the parties are different (mainly superstores and supermarkets for Colgate Palmolive and specialised networks (pharmacies, health and beauty stores, perfume shops, etc.) and department stores for Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques).

Following an examination of the effects of this transaction on the urban and interurban public passenger transport markets outside the Île-de-France region, the Autorité de la concurrence has cleared this transaction without conditions. Parties to the transaction Keolis is a subsidiary of SNCF, which provides (urban and interurban) passenger transport services in France. CarPostal France, a subsidiary of the Swiss company CarPostal SA, which is owned by La Poste Suisse SA, is active in the urban and interurban passenger transport sector in France, particularly in the east and south-east. The planned transaction is not likely to harm competition The parties are simultaneously active in the public passenger transport market outside the Île-de-France region, more specifically in the urban and interurban passenger transport markets in the départements of Isère, Loire, Saône-et-Loire, Hérault and Bouches-du-Rhône. Competition in these markets takes place during the response to calls for tenders issued by public authorities (cities, départements, regions), at the national level for the urban public passenger transport market, and at the departmental level for the interurban passenger transport market. With regard to the urban passenger transport market outside the Île-de-France region, the Autorité de la concurrence noted that Keolis and CarPostal France did not generally apply for the same calls for tender. The Autorité was able to eliminate any risk of harm to competition by taking into account the presence of other competitors, such as Transdev and RATP Dev. As regards the interurban passenger transport market outside the Île-de-France region, the investigation revealed that the parties exercised competitive pressure between themselves in certain départements, but that the parties had limited market shares. In addition, after an analysis in each département, it appears that competitors, such as Transdev or local operators, are also active on these markets.

Background On 8 July 2019, Société Antillaise Frigorifique (SAFO) notified the Autorité de la concurrence of its acquisition of NDIS and its subsidiary NG Kon Tia, both active in the food retail sector in French Guiana. At the end of the investigation, which led the Autorité to consult a large number of operators in the sector (retailers, wholesalers, suppliers), the Autorité cleared the transaction, subject to structural and behavioural commitments, some of which will have to be implemented before the completion of the operation. The commitments presented by SAFO allow an independent hypermarket brand in French Guiana to continue operating and thus to preserve a diversity of offer for the consumers. The also allow not to strengthen SAFO's position in the food and non-food wholesale markets in French Guiana. SAFO will have, before completing the transaction, to sell NG Kon Tia's wholesaler-importer business and obtain the agreement of its buyer, in order to ensure that it is able to maintain sufficient competition. It is the first time that the Autorité sets up this type of remedy on a so-called « up-front buyer » prior sale. Parties to the transaction The company SAFO, controlled by the Huyghues-Despointes family, is active in the predominantly food retail sector in the French Antilles-French Guiana region and in mainland France. In French Guiana, SAFO operates a Carrefour Market located in Rémire-Montjoly, near Cayenne (973) and conducts an affiliate management business under Proxi sign license agreements and franchise agreements 8 à Huit (Carrefour Group). In addition, SAFO is active in the food and non-food wholesale and semi-wholesale sector through its subsidiaries Sofrigu and Rémidis. NDIS, controlled by the NG Kon Tia family, operates a hypermarket under the brand Super NKT, located in Cayenne (973). Through its subsidiary NG Kon Tia, NDIS is also active in the food and non-food wholesale sector. Finally, NG Kon Tia owns a commercial real estate complex.  Identified competition risks After realising a detailed examination of the effects of the transaction and consultation with numerous operators in the food retail sector in French Guiana, the Autorité identified risks of harm to competition.  Two main risks to competition were identified in the food and non-food retail and wholesale markets in French Guiana. •   The transaction would have entailed a risk of a hypermarket brand in French Guiana disappearing In the catchment area affected, three independent hypermarket brands are currently present: Super NKT, Carrefour (Groupe GBH) and Hyper U. The SAFO group now benefiting from a brand and sourcing agreement with the Carrefour group, operating the Super NKT store under the Carrefour brand would have resulted in a reduction in the number of competing brands in the area from three to two, with the consumer therefore losing an alternative for their shopping in an already highly concentrated French Guianese market. In a wider market, which includes all forms of retail (supermarkets, convenience stores), the transaction could also strengthen the already prominent position of the Carrefour brand and eliminate an independent brand. •   SAFO's market shares in the wholesale markets could have been strengthened by the acquisition of NG Kon Tia Particular attention was paid to the wholesale distribution of fresh products (yoghurt, butter, cream desserts, fruit, vegetables, etc.) and frozen products from Sofrigu (SAFO) and NG Kon Tia (NDIS) in French Guiana, intended for the retail sector in particular. As part of the various market tests (consultation of market stakeholders) carried out during the investigation, several operators in the sector indicated that Sofrigu and NG Kon Tia were the two main wholesaler-importers for these product categories in French Guiana, and they worried about the consequences of the transaction, particularly in terms of the conditions under which they would access these products for their activity. Commitments •   SAFO will operate the hypermarket acquired under a brand that does not include the Carrefour brand In order to remedy the risk of the harm to competition resulting from the disappearance of an independent retailer, SAFO has made a commitment not to run the hypermarket under one of Carrefour's brands. The contracts that will be signed between SAFO and Carrefour Group must grant the hypermarket commercial independence, both in terms of product range and pricing policy, that the other stores operating under Carrefour brands in French Guiana (Carrefour, 8 à Huit and Proxi) do not have . These provisions will in particular enable SAFO Group to compete effectively with Carrefour Group in French Guiana insofar as it will be able to freely determine its commercial strategy with regard to its master franchisor. This commitment will therefore enable SAFO to effectively compete, in respect of price, quality and the range of products on sale, with the Carrefour and Hyper U hypermarkets present in the catchment area, and more generally with all the competing food retailers in French Guiana. A commitment of the same nature aiming at preserving the diversity of the brands for the consumer, had been accepted by the Autorité de la concurrence in its decision 18-DCC-142 regarding the acquisition of Géant Casino hyper in the city of Le Robert in Martinique by Groupe Bernard Hayot. •  SAFO undertakes to sell NG Kon Tia's wholesaler-importer business as part of a prior sale commitment (“up-front-buyer”). SAFO has committed not to carry out the transaction until it has divested NG Kon Tia's entire wholesaler-importer business and obtained the Autorité's approval on this sale. The Autorité will notably determine if the buyer of the business is able to maintain competition. Under competition law, this is an upfront divestiture commitment (or “up-front-buyer”) which offers a high guarantee of effectiveness in its implementation insofar as the transaction cannot be carried out until the buyer of the assets transferred is approved, that is, until the Autorité has ensured that the buyer has all the guarantees required for the takeover (independence, continuation of activity). The completion of the transaction is thus subjected to these two conditions. The upfront divestiture procedure (up-front-buyer): an additional guarantee of the effectiveness of the structural remedy undertaken The structural commitment undertaken by SAFO in response to the risk of harm to competition identified in the food and non-food wholesale markets is an up-front-buyer commitment. This is a specific type of commitment provided for in paragraph 590 of the Autorité de la concurrence's merger control guidelines. The procedure limits the risk of transfers of shares that would experience particular difficulties, unknown to the Autorité, and which would make performing the transfer difficult. This is the first time that the Autorité de la concurrence has accepted such a commitment. The European Commission, for its part, had already accepted such commitments on several occasions, notably in the context of the case M.7567 regarding the acquisition of the cans producer Ball by its competitor Rexam in 2016. The Autorité's proposals on the competitive risks of wholesaler-importers' vertical integration In its opinion 19-A-12 on the operation of competition in overseas distribution, the Autorité had in particular highlighted the importance of competition issues in relation to wholesaler-importers, particularly if they are vertically integrated with distribution groups. The Autorité had indeed noted that a non-negligible share of the overseas distribution groups is indeed also present as wholesaler-importers in the wholesale market. She pointed out the competitive risks of this vertical integration (presence of an actor at the different levels of the chain), in particular in the allocation of commercial cooperation budgets (tariff advantages granted by the supplier to the distributor for the promotion of its products in stores or catalogues). An integrated player can indeed be encouraged to favour its brands at the expense of its competitors. The Autorité has therefore recommended strengthening the rules applicable to the overseas territories to prevent the discrimination of actors in the event of vertical integration. > > See full text of the decision 19-DCC-180 of 27 September 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

For its part Léon de Bruxelles has a chain of 82 restaurants under the Léon de Bruxelles brand. In 2019, the group diversified by opening two English-style fast-food seafood restaurants under the Fish'Tro brand in Créteil (94) and Vélizy (78).  The Autorité clears the acquisition without conditions Both groups operate competing restaurant chains in the high-end restaurant market, with table service, which differs from the low-cost fast food market (which includes fast food, self-service and take-away/home delivery). However, due to the presence of a large n umber of competitors (Pizza Pino, Paradis du Fruit, Buffalo Grill, Indiana Café, etc.) in each local area where both companies have restaurants, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns that would hinder the acquisition .

On 14 November 2019, Casino notified the Autorité de la concurrence of its planned acquisition of exclusive control - it hitherto had joint control - of the companies Capdis and Holding Mag Spring, which operate 198 predominantly food sales outlets under various brand names belonging to the group.  The parties to the transaction The company Franprix Leader Price Holding is a subsidiary of Casino Group. It owns stakes in companies that operate stores under Casino brand names such as Franprix, Leader Price and Monoprix. Prior to the transaction, Capdis and Holding Mag Spring were controlled by Casino Group and the Zouari family. They operate 198 sales outlets, which mainly sell food, with surface areas ranging from 62 to 2 753 m². These stores are primarily supermarkets located mainly in Paris and in the suburbs of Paris and operated under the brand name Casino, Franprix or Leader Price. After examining the transaction, the Autorité was able to rule out any competition concerns, as the level of competition in the affected catchment areas was sufficient. After examining the effects of this transaction on competition in the various catchment areas in which the sales outlets that have been taken over are located - and which will continue to operate under the same brand name - the Autorité ruled out any competition concerns. In all of the areas analysed, Casino will have markets shares of less than 50% and will continue to be competing with a sufficient number of rival distribution groups (Carrefour, U, Leclerc, etc.), which, through their own sales outlets, will be in a position to exercise competitive constraint in terms of price and diversity of supply, for example. They thus constitute credible alternatives for consumers wishing to do their shopping. Consequently, the Autorité has cleared this transaction unconditionally.  > See text of decision 19-DCC-239 of 12 December 2019 What are the differences between exclusive control and joint control? When two or more companies have the possibility of exercising a decisive influence over another company, the control is joint . Each of the controlling companies must be able to block the strategic decisions of the controlled company. A company has exclusive control when it can exercise, on its own, decisive influence over the activity of another company.  The acquisition of exclusive control over a company that was previously under the joint control of several shareholders constitutes a merger, as it gives rise to a change in the type of control exercised over the company. In such a case, the Autorité carries out a competitive analysis in order to assess whether the company that is acquiring the exclusive control is likely to change its competitive behaviour. As a result of the transaction, the company is in a position to determine on its own the strategy of the controlled company while, previously, it had to take into account the interests of the other shareholders and cooperate with them on a continuous basis. As the transaction notified by Casino fell within this framework, it was submitted to the Autorité for examination. Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

In a decision handed down today, the Autorité clears the transaction without it being subjected to any particular conditions. The parties to the transaction L'Oréal Group is a French group that markets cosmetic products across the world. In France, it markets luxury perfumes and cosmetics (brands such as Lancôme, Giorgio Armani and Yves Saint Laurent) within selective distribution networks (perfume stores such as Sephora, Marionnaud, etc.), as well as consumer products sold primarily in mass retail distribution networks (brands such as L'Oréal Paris and Maybelline). The company Clarins, which is one of the leading French luxury cosmetics groups, also markets perfumes under the brand names Azzaro and Thierry Mugler. In France, these products are primarily marketed in selective distribution networks. The transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité examined in particular whether the acquisition of the marketing of luxury perfumes and cosmetic products by L'Oréal Group under the brand names Azzaro and Thierry Mugler, which formerly belonged to Clarins, was likely to restrict competition on the distribution markets for luxury cosmetic products sold on selective distribution networks. It noted that consumers will continue to have many alternatives to this new entity given the presence of international operators that own important brands such as: LVMH (Guerlain, Dior…), Coty (Burberry, Calvin Klein, Boss…) Chanel (N°5, Allure…), Estée Lauder (Bronze Goddess, Intuition…), Sisley (Soir de lune, Eau du soir…).

This transaction is part of Le Groupe La Poste's strategy to diversify its activities, resulting in multiple mergers which have been controlled by the Autorité de la concurrence 1 .  Parties to the transaction Le Groupe La Poste is the incumbent operator which runs the state postal service in France. It owns a number of subsidiaries which are organised into five business units: Parcels & Mail Services, GeoPost (international express delivery of parcels under 30 kg, business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C), La Banque Postale, La Poste Network, and Digital Services. Within the Digital Services business unit, Docaposte, a subsidiary of Le Groupe La Poste, develops new digital tools to support companies in their digital transformation. Softeam is a company specialising in information technology consulting which provides IT consulting services, project management and prime contractorship, as well as digital communication and training. Softeam also works in the field of technology for digital transformation, providing services relating to data management as well as Artificial Intelligence tools.  Markets examined Both parties work in the IT services markets. La Poste also operates in document and data management for third parties and colocation services (or data centres ) via its subsidiary Docaposte. Regarding this transaction, the Autorité found that, in the last ten years, the IT services markets have been subject to constant innovation and that this must be taken into account. For its examination, the Autorité questioned the key competitors of the parties to the transaction in this market. Thanks to this market test (consulting operators in the market), the Autorité learned a great deal about the structure and workings of the IT services (or digital services) markets. In this context, the Autorité identified two new segmentations of the IT services markets aimed at integrating these innovations: the first relates to new activities that come under the acronym \"SMACS\", meaning: Social ; Mobile; Analytics ; Cloud and Security. These activities are considered by the key players in the sector to be the major drivers needed for the digital transformation of the economy. the second segmentation is related to key innovations: Artificial Intelligence; the Internet of Things, or \"IoT\"; blockchain ; big data;  cloud services; virtual and augmented reality; robotics; and high-performance computing.  The transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité looked at whether or not the acquisition of Softeam by Le Groupe La Poste would restrict competition in the markets for IT services, document and data management for third parties and that for colocation services ( data centres ). Regarding the latter, the Autorité analysed the conglomerate effects of the transaction linked to the existence of a unique advantage, namely Le Groupe La Poste's brand image, as the incumbent operator of postal services, insofar as regards the security and confidentiality of its customers' personal data. The Autorité found that the operation does not significantly strengthen the position of the new entity across all these markets, partly due to the presence of many other competitors providing integrated digital services, and partly due to the parties' limited positions in the markets in question. The Autorité therefore cleared the transaction without making it subject to any special conditions. Previous Autorité de la concurrence decisions on mergers regarding La Poste: 19-DCC-195 of 22 October 2019 regarding the acquisition of exclusive control of Économie d'Énergie by Le Groupe La Poste; 17-DCC-209 of 21 December 2017 regarding setting up a joint venture by La Poste and Suez RV France in the collection and recovery of non-hazardous office waste sector; 17-DCC-74 of 1 June 2017 regarding the acquisition of exclusive control of Asten Santé by La Poste Silver in the healthcare services sector. In addition, the Autorité de la concurrence will shortly rule on the merger that will take Le Groupe La Poste from joint control with the French State and put it under the exclusive control of the Caisse des dépôts et consignations (CDC), as well as on the acquisition, by La Banque Postale (LBP), of exclusive control of CNP Assurances (CNP). > See text of decision 19-DCC-259 of 18 december 2019  1 For example, see Decisions 19-DCC-195 (Economie d'Energie / La Poste), 17-DCC-209  (Suez RV / La Poste) and 17-DCC-74 (Asten Santé / La Poste Silver)  Formerly known as software engineering companies, such companies specialise in the field of new technology and computing. 3 Social refers to activities relating to social networks. 4 Analytics generally means the use of statistics and data, as well as the use of big data and Artificial Intelligence. 5 Data centre colocation is used to host the entire IT infrastructure of a company that does not have either the resources or the space required to install a computer system, by renting a room in a data centre. 6 Conglomerate effects may exist when the new entity extends or strengthens its presence in markets other than those in which it operates, but the related nature of which could help it to increase its market power.

After examining the effects of the transaction, the Autorité de la concurrence has cleared the transaction unconditionall The parties to the transaction The French industrial Groupe Snef is active in electrical engineering and instrumentation, notably in the nuclear sector. Steam Power Delta is a company created for the purposes of the transaction, encompassing the electrical engineering activity in the nuclear sector of Alstom Power Service and Protea, a French manufacturer of electric boards and cabinets, particularly for nuclear infrastructure. Steam Power Delta is currently owned by General Electric.  The proposed transaction is not likely to harm competition During its investigation, the Autorité de la concurrence extensively consulted operators active in electric engineering for the nuclear sector, as well as customers. Through this analysis, it selected relevant markets specific to the nuclear sector: the markets for electrical engineering services and industrial supply. These markets were analysed as separate from the non-nuclear electrical engineering and industrial supply markets. The Autorité examined whether Groupe Snef's acquisition of Steam Power Delta was likely to restrict competition in the electrical engineering and industrial supply markets within the nuclear sector. The Autorité found that after the transaction, Groupe Snef will continue to have competitors of similar size. It also found that Groupe Snef's customers in the markets in question are major project owners (EDF, Orano, CEA) with strong negotiating power. The Autorité thus ruled out any risk of the transaction having anticompetitive effects.  > See the full text of decision 19-DCC-265 of the 26 December 2019  Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

Parties to the transaction Biocodex is active in the creation, manufacture and distribution of health products in France and abroad. It mainly markets medicinal products and dietary supplements (particularly the Symbiosys range, based on probiotic strains). Iprad is active in the creation, manufacture and distribution of health and well-being products in France and abroad, notably in the gynaecology and intimate feminine hygiene sector. In particular, Iprad markets medicinal products and dietary supplements. The proposed transaction is not likely to harm competition Given Biocodex's and Iprad's activities, the Autorité , in its investigation of the case, analysed in particular whether the acquisition of Iprad by Biocodex was likely to restrict competition in the dietary supplement market. It considered that these products are distinct from basic foodstuffs (due to their unique nutritional and physiological effect) and from pharmaceutical products (notably given the very different regulatory framework).   The Autorité 's finding was that after the transaction, Biocodex's positions in the dietary supplements market would be very limited and that it would face competition from other operators, such as Pileje and Probiotil.  The Autorité also analysed the effects of the transaction on the pharmaceutical products market. Given that the product portfolios of Biocodex and Iprad are different, the Autorité ruled out any competition concerns in this market.

The parties to the transaction The agricultural cooperative Océalia belongs to Océalia, which is active in the collection and marketing of cereal, oilseed and pulse crops, consulting and sale of agricultural supplies, operation of garden centres (under the brands Gamm Vert, Gamm Vert Village and Gamm Vert Nature), production and sale of seeds, production and sale of popcorn, and production of foods for animal nutrition, in the Nouvelle Aquitaine and Poitou-Charentes regions.

While there is only slight overlap in the animal nutrition and gardening, DIY, landscaping and pet product retail distribution markets, the Autorité had to carefully examine the risks of significantly reducing local competition in the cereal, oilseed and pulse crop collection sector and in the agricultural supply distribution markets. It based its review on recent and extensive decision-making practice, and consulted stakeholders in these markets. Following its investigation, the Autorité considered that the level of competition, notably in terms of price, will remain sufficient to rule out any risk of the transaction harming competition.

On the other hand, it authorizes the Caisse des dépôts et consignations ( Deposits and Consignments Fund ) to exercise sole control – from now on- over the La Poste group. These clearances were given without any specific condition. These two transactions- which are simultaneous- arise from the re-organization of the La Poste group and the CNP Assurances holding of capitals in order to create – at the Government's initiative- a public « bancassurance » pole. In view of the presence of the Caisse des dépôts et consignations and the La Poste group in numerous economic sectors, the analysis carried out by the Autorité focused on a great number of markets in various sectors. The banking, insurance, real estate, data and document processing, Internet access and healthcare sectors were among the sectors concerned. The Autorité paid particular attention to the insurance markets, in which CNP Assurances and La Banque Postale are present, along with the banking markets in which La Banque Postale and the Caisse des dépôts et consignations are present. Among other topics, the Autorité looked into the consequences of regrouping the banking and insurance activities within a same group. It noted that the respective market share of the parties in all of the markets identified remained moderate, and that other powerful players in the banking and insurance sectors were active in these markets, such as Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel, BNP-Paribas and BPCE. Finally, the Autorité noted the emergence of new online offers (neobank). Taking into consideration all of these elements along with the market share of the parties to the transaction which remain limited, the Autorité ruled out any competition issue in these markets. > See the text of decision 19-DCC-270 of 30 December 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

On 25 June 2019, Mediaco Levage and Capelle Investissements notified the Autorité de la concurrence of the following three transactions: the acquisition of sole control by the Mediaco group of AltéAd and the assets of 12 companies of the AltéAd group; the acquisition of sole control by the Capelle group of AltéAd Marchal Levage, of the assets of the transport division of the AltéAd group and Infinitrans; the acquisition of joint control by the Mediaco and Capelle groups of Financière de Corton, AltéAd Management and AltéAd Industries Est. These three transactions are part of a legal proceeding opened by the tribunal de commerce de Paris on 27 May 2019 for all the companies in the AltéAd group. The Autorité granted three derogations from the suspensive effect of merger control to the Mediaco and Capelle groups on 11 July 2019 (see box below). By judgment dated 26 July 2019, the tribunal de commerce de Paris approved the disposal of these three transactions. The Autorité issues today its decision on the last two transactions (Capelle / AltéAd Marchal Levage and Mediaco-Capelle / AltéAd). The first transaction is currently being reviewed.  Parties to the transaction The Mediaco group specializes in the lifting and handling of heavy loads, in particular through a network of 70 agencies in France. It also offers industrial services and logistics services. The Capelle Group, present in France, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom, is active in specialized and abnormal transport, handling and logistics. The AltéAd group has four divisions: transport, lifting, industry (which carries out technical studies, industrial assembly, installation and equipment and machinery implementation), MTM & Solutions (which offers logistics services).  Markets examined The parties are simultaneously active in the road freight transport markets, engineering services and, in the case of the Capelle group, logistics. In this transaction, the Autorité defined two new markets within the road freight market: - The abnormal road freight transport market: movement of \"goods, machinery or vehicles of an exceptional nature because of their size or mass exceeding the statutory limits ». This market is of national dimension. - The specialized road freight transport market: this is the means used to transport atypical goods and products requiring the use of specialized tools. This mode of transport is not to be mistaken with abnormal transport, in so far as it does not specifically concern objects of exceptional mass or volume. This market is of national dimension.  In order to carry out its investigation, the Autorité de la concurrence interviewed the customers and competitors of the parties to the transaction in each of these markets. These market consultations (consultations of market operators) helped to deepen the knowledge of the structure and functioning of these markets. As the operations were not likely to harm competition, the Autorité therefore cleared them without conditions.  \t Regarding the acquisition made by Capelle \t Given the market shares of the new entity, still below 25% regardless of the retained markets and segments, the transaction was not likely to harm competition. The Autorité cleared the implementation of the transaction.  \t Regarding the joint transaction by Mediaco and Capelle \t Given the market shares of the new entity, still below 25% regardless of the retained markets and segments, the transaction was not likely to harm competition. The Autorité cleared the implementation of the transaction.  > See the full text of the decision 19-DCC-235 > See the full text of the decision 19-DCC-268 What is a derogation from the suspensive effect? If the effective conclusion of a merger is subject to approval from the Autorité de la concurrence , in certain exceptional circumstances, duly argued by the parties, the Autorité may issue a derogation enabling them to finalise part or all of the transaction without waiting for the approval decision. Although derogations from the suspensive effect are by definition exceptional, cases in which offers to take over concern companies subject to receivership or liquidation proceedings can lead to beneficial decisions. A derogation may also be justified in other exceptional circumstances, such as a risk of imminent dissolution of the acquisition target, the initiation of collective proceedings or the need for an acquiring party to provide guarantees or obtain financing to keep the target afloat. However, the issue of a derogation by the Autorité is without prejudice to the final decision made in the light of its full assessment. Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Given changes to the markets, the Autorité de la concurrence will not renew the commitments made by Altice upon acquiring SFR. However, the injunctions with penalty payments ordered by the Autorité in 2017 for the agreement on co-deployment of the fibre optic network executed with Bouygues Telecom (“Faber” agreement) are upheld. The Autorité's two decisions governing the behaviour of Altice since the acquisition of SFR Decision of 30 October 2014 giving conditional clearance to the acquisition of SFR (14‑DCC‑160)/ see press release On 30 October 2014, the Autorité de la concurrence gave clearance for the exclusive acquisition of SFR by Altice, subject to the implementation of several commitments. Multiple commitments were made for a period of five years starting on 30 October 2014. These commitments have now expired, but could have been renewed once if justified by the market conditions. Decision of 8 March 2017 (17-D-04) fining Altice for failing to honour commitments made in 2014 concerning the co-deployment of an optical fibre network executed with Bouygues Telecom/ see press release Given Altice's cumulated delay in connecting fibre-ready buildings in the zone covered by the “Faber” agreement to the network co-financed by Bouygues Telecom, despite having made a commitment that set out the conditions of this connection, the Autorité fined Altice €40 million and required it to comply with a new calendar for completion, and associated penalty payments. On 23 January 2019, Altice requested these injunctions be lifted. The Autorité therefore analysed the competitive context in the zone covered by the agreement. Changes to the markets since 2014 mean that the Autorité will not extend the commitments made by Altice for an additional five years. However, it shall uphold the injunctions with penalty payments ordered in 2017. On the opening of the cable network to competing operators The existence of the Numericable network (owned by Altice) led the Autorité to identify a risk of Altice pre-empting very high-speed internet customers in the zones where cable was deployed but fibre optic internet was not yet available. Altice therefore committed to providing all telecom operators with access to its cable network (via two reference offers) and to refrain from using information that it receives as an operator deploying a fibre optic network to sell very high-speed internet offers on the cable network in buildings eligible for fibre optic internet.  Commitment lifted Retail operators, especially Orange, have significantly deployed their fibre optic network, such that the risk of pre-emption in cabled zones has been significantly reduced. The Autorité consequently considered it unnecessary to renew commitments relating to cable network access and information received by Altice. On the ban on selling cable offers in post offices  Altice also committed to refrain from selling very high-speed cable network offers in branches of Le Groupe La Poste, with whom SFR had executed an exclusive distribution agreement.  Commitment lifted The Autorité has noted changes to the internet access distribution market and the end of the exclusivity clause in the distribution contract executed between La Poste and SFR. It has therefore not renewed the commitment relating to the distribution of cable offers in post offices. On dark fibre offers for telecom operators and offers to access its optical local fibre loops via dedicated optical local loop (DOLL) offers (upstream business market)  The Autorité had identified a risk of withdrawal from the market or price increases for SFR dark fibre offers after the transaction. These offers enable telecom operators to build or supplement their core network. Altice committed to maintaining offers on the dark fibre supply markets, under conditions at least as beneficial as before the transaction. The Autorité had also identified a risk of price increases or market withdrawal for wholesale capacity services on the terminal segment on dedicated optical local loops (DOLL) in the upstream business market. These offers allow telecom operators to build business solutions and to compete with “integrated” operators such as Orange and Altice. Altice committed to maintaining wholesale DOLL offers, under conditions at least as beneficial as before the transaction.  Commitments lifted The Autorité has observed that since 2014, credible alternatives to Altice offers have emerged, such that it no longer has the capacity to lock access to its wholesale DOLL or dark fibre offers for telecom operators. The Autorité consequently considered that it was unnecessary to extend the DOLL and dark fibre commitments. On connecting buildings in the zone covered by the “Faber” agreement to the fibre network co-financed by SFR and Bouygues After this transaction, Altice could have prevented Bouygues Telecom from accessing very high-speed internet customers across a significant part of this very dense zone. Bouygues Telecom was dependent on SFR to connect fibre-ready buildings to the shared network deployed by SFR and Bouygues Telecom. Altice therefore committed to connect the fibre-ready buildings in this zone to the network deployed by SFR and Bouygues Telecom. This commitment would have allowed Bouygues Telecom to use the network in which it had invested with SFR and to promote competition in this zone. These connections were meant to be carried out within the timeframe and under the terms set out in the commitments. Altice did not honour this commitment and was fined by the Autorité in 2017 (see  press release of 9 March 2017 ). At the same time, it issued injunctions to ensure that Altice would effectively connect the fibre-ready buildings in the zone covered by the Faber agreement. These injunctions identified two situations: for the fibre-ready buildings which had not been connected as of the date of the 2017 decision, Altice had one additional year to connect them (injunctions with penalty payments). For buildings that would be made fibre-ready from the date of the decision, Altice was to connect them under the conditions set out in the initial commitments (injunctions without penalty payments). The injunctions without penalty payments are lifted Given that these injunctions relate to the Faber agreement and the associated commitments, the Autorité has observed that the Altice group has changed its strategy and now promotes the deployment of fibre optic internet. Its interests are consequently now aligned with those of Bouygues Telecom in connecting the buildings in the “Faber” zone. Furthermore, the Autorité has taken into account changes made to the Faber agreement via an amendment executed between Altice and Bouygues Telecom in December 2018. These changes incorporate into the agreement itself mechanisms similar to those implemented for the commitments made in 2014, and reiterated by the injunctions ordered in 2017. The Autorité therefore considers it unnecessary to uphold these injunctions for the future as these changes guarantee that the buildings that are fibre-ready from the date hereof will be effectively connected by Altice to the network co-financed by Bouygues Telecom. The injunctions with penalty payments are upheld However, the Autorité upholds the injunctions with penalty payments ordered in 2017, as they were intended, within the given timeframes, to offset the direct consequences of Altice's failure to honour its commitments (i.e. a number of fibre-ready buildings not connected before 2014 or between 2014 and 2017). The Autorité will rule on whether they should be liquidated and lifted as part of a separate ongoing investigation, which should give rise to a decision in the first half of 2020.  BACKGROUND 30 October 2014 ( Decision no. 14‑DCC‑160 ): The Autorité gave clearance for the exclusive acquisition of SFR by the Altice group, subject to structural and behavioural commitments  19 April 2016 ( Decision no. 16‑D‑07 ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €15 million for failing to honour certain commitments related to the divestiture of the mobile telephone business of Outremer Telecom, pursuant to Decision no. 14-DCC-160.  8 November 2016 ( Decision no. 16-D-24 ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €80 million for the premature completion of two transactions notified in 2014, including the transaction cleared by Decision no.14-DCC-160. 8 March 2017 ( Decision no. 17‑D‑04 ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €40 million for failing to honour its commitments related to the “Faber” agreement, pursuant to Decision no. 14-DCC-160. It also ordered several injunctions, including some with penalty payments.

The parties  NJJ is active in the media sector. As such, it holds, through its subsidiaries, controlling interests in the companies that publish Le Monde newspaper and L'Obs magazine as well as the related websites. GNM publishes the regional daily newspapers Nice-Matin, Var-Matin and Monaco-Matin , as well as their websites. NJJ, which has held only a non-controlling interest since 2019, will have sole control of GNM after the transaction. Limited business overlap Given the differences in the nature of the different titles published by GNM (regional daily newspapers) and NJJ (national daily newspapers and magazines), the transaction does not give rise to any overlap in the print media sector. On the other hand, the transaction gives rise to very limited overlaps in the markets for the operation of online editorial sites and the sale of online advertising space. In view of the very marked differences between the readership and advertisers of the two groups, any risk of tied selling could be ruled out The competitive analysis of the transaction has led to an examination of the risk of ‘tied selling' between the various national daily newspapers, magazines and regional daily newspapers published by the parties, as well as between the advertising space and classified ads in these publications. Noting the very marked differences between the readership of these different newspapers and the low paid circulation of the newspapers published by NJJ in the Var and Alpes-Maritimes départements , the Autorité ruled out any risk of coupling these different NJJ activities to the detriment of readers following the transaction. For the same reasons, the Autorité has ruled out such a risk with regard to classified advertisements. Having noted the differences between the advertisers of the regional newspapers published by GNM and the national publications of NJJ, the Autorité also ruled out the risk of tied selling of advertising space in the various titles published by the new entity. The Autorité de la concurrence therefore cleared the transaction without conditions.  > See the text of decision 20-DCC-09 of 17 January 2020  Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The Zouari family, together with Lion Capital investment fund, notified the Autorité de la concurrence of its plan to acquire joint control of Picard Group. Parties to the transaction The Zouari family controls retail food stores operating under the Casino banner. Until the end of 2019, the Zouari family controlled, alone or jointly, several hundred stores operating under the Casino banner. Since t he vast majority of these stores were sold to Casino (see Decision 19-DCC-239 of 12 December 2019 by which the Autorité cleared Casino's acquisition of sole control of 198 retail outlets/ read the press release ), the Zouari family now controls only some stores under the Casino, Leader Price, Franprix and Monoprix banners, located mainly in Paris and the surrounding region. Lion Capital is a UK investment fund that already holds a controlling interest, i.e., enabling it to influence strategic decisions, in Picard Group. Picard Group is active in the distribution of frozen products and operates more than 1,000 stores in France and abroad. The range of products sold in stores, almost exclusively under the Picard brand, includes more than 1,000 references ranging from starters to desserts and from ingredients to ready-made meals. Markets concerned by the transaction During the investigation, the Autorité consulted widely with operators in the distribution of frozen food products, both at the national and local level, in order to define the markets concerned by the retail distribution of frozen food products. As a result of the consultation, the Autorité found that, despite the differences in the selection of frozen products offered by the Picard stores on the one hand and those of the Zouari family on the other, the latter exert effective competitive pressure on the frozen food stores. In order to define the catchment areas of shops retailing frozen food products, in line with the answers provided by the respondents, the Autorité transposed the national decision-making practice on the geographical delineation of markets in the food retail sector. Accordingly, in view of these various findings, the Autorité analysed the effects of the transaction on the markets for the retail distribution of frozen foods, including both specialised superstores and food superstores, in the catchment areas of each of the Picard stores. Competitive analysis  The Autorité found that the transaction leads to overlaps between the Zouari family and the Picard Group in the market for the retail distribution of frozen food in 75 areas. The Autorité carried out a detailed analysis for the areas where the new entity will, as a result of the transaction, have a market share above 50%. Following an analysis taking account of the specific features of these different areas, and based on market tests carried out with local operators for the most problematic areas, the Autorité has ruled out any risk of anticompetitive effects linked to the transaction, since it has established that there is a sufficient and credible competing offer that will give consumers an alternative in terms of prices, brands and products .  In addition, the Autorité has also endeavoured to respond to the concerns of some of the parties questioned regarding changes to the offerings of Picard stores, in particular by adding fresh produce or by converting stores currently under the Picard banner into food superstores (Casino, Leader Price, Franprix and Monoprix). According to its analysis, the Autorité considers such a change to be unlikely given the risk of loss of profitability of the target and the joint nature of the control exercised over Picard Group. At the end of its analysis, the Autorité cleared the transaction without conditions.  > See the text of decision 20-DDC-06 of 15 January 2019 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The parties to the transaction The Pain Frotté group operates artisanal bakeries in La Réunion under the trade names “L'Ambassadeur”, “Délicatesses Casta” and “Pain Frotté”. Kin Siong is a family-owned group that specialises in the operation of hypermarkets (Hyper U Le-Tampon- Chatoire, etc.) and supermarkets (Leader Price Beauséjour) in La Réunion. Lam Tow is a family-owned group that specialises in the sale of everyday consumer retail products, particular food products, in La Réunion (U Express in Petite-Île, U Express in Saint-Pierre). These two groups sell bakery products at some of their retail outlets. Yong Wai Man is a family-owned group specialising in producing and wholesaling bakery products. The transaction does not raise any competition issues in the vast majority of the catchment areas The parties are simultaneously active on the downstream distribution market for bakery products whereas one of the groups involved in the takeover (Yong Wai Man) is also present on the upstream wholesale market for bakery products, of which it holds a significant share. The Autorité considered that any risk of harm to competition could be ruled out on the retail distribution markets for bakery products as the transaction would give rise only to an overlapping of activities in Saint-Pierre-de-La-Réunion, where the market share of the new entity will remain limited. In light of the upstream presence of one of the groups involved in the takeover, the Autorité also examined whether the transaction was likely to undermine the conditions of supply to the bakery outlets competing with those outlets covered by the takeover. The Autorité ruled out such a risk in 11 of the 12 areas in which Pain Frotté is present. Trois Bassins, the only catchment area in which the transaction raises competition issues However, the services of the Autorité focused their attention on the Trois Bassins area. In this area, the only competitor of Pain Frotté is a sales outlet that is supplied by the Yong Wai Man group and whose bakery products it would find difficult to obtain from another supplier. In this area, the Autorité considered that the new entity may have an incentive to increase the wholesale prices of its bakery products in order to make the sales outlet competing with its own sales outlet less competitive, thereby benefiting from customers crossing over to its own bakery. The new entity will sell the bakery located in the Trois Bassins area The new entity has, however, agreed to sell its bakery in the Trois Bassins area, thereby dispelling any risk of undermining the conditions of supply to the competing sales outlet and protecting the purchasing power of consumers in La Réunion.

After examining the effects of the transaction, the Autorité has cleared this transaction unconditionally. The parties to the transaction The Spirit group, an American equipment manufacturer, is a supplier of aerospace components. It chiefly produces wing, fuselage and nacelle components (also referred to as “aerostructures”) for airliners. Spirit's customers include aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Dassault and Gulfstream. The Spirit group had a global turnover of $7.9 billion in 2019. Bombardier is an international Canadian group, once of the main players in the air (notably business aviation) and rail transport sector. The Bombardier assets purchased manufacture aerostructure components for aircraft and also offer maintenance and repair services for aerostructure components. The customers of the assets divested are the Bombardier group, as well as third-party aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus and Gulfstream. The proposed transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité analysed the various component supply markets for aircraft, in addition to the markets for spare parts and maintenance services. Although the transaction involves several overlapping activities (horizontal effects), the Autorité has established that numerous competitors are present in these markets, such as, for example, Collins Aerospace, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Safran, Korea Aerospace Industries, Alenia, Sonaca Group, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Magellan and GKN. It also concluded that the parties were not the closest competitors, as the production activities of the Bombardier target assets are heavily oriented towards business aircraft, specifically Bombardier aircraft, while the Spirit group produces components chiefly aimed at large-capacity aircraft, in particular Boeing aircraft. Lastly, the Autorité identified the countervailing powers of the aircraft manufacturers in these markets (Airbus, Boeing, Dassault and Bombardier Gulfstream), due to their limited number (oligopsony) on the one hand, and their internal production capacities on the other. Furthermore, when analysing the other effects [1] , the Autorité decided that the new entity would have neither the capacity nor the incentive to impose foreclosure mechanisms on inputs or customers, notably due to the existence of competitive alternatives, the awarding of contracts through calls for tender, the duration of contracts and the countervailing powers of the aircraft manufacturers. At the end of its competitive analysis, the Autorité cleared the transaction unconditionally.  [1]  The other effects studied are the vertical effects generated by companies active in markets positioned at different stages of the value chain, and the conglomerate effects arising from the extension or strengthening of the presence of the new entity in different, yet connected, markets.

After examining the effects of the transaction, the Autorité cleared the transaction without conditions. Parties to the transaction CACF is a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole Group and specialises in consumer credit. It offers financing, insurance and service solutions. Crédit Agricole Group is a leading player in the banking sector, active in commercial banking, insurance, corporate and investment banking, savings management and financial services. Ménafinance is active in the field of consumer loans, particularly for Fnac-Darty customers. It also distributes insurance products, including creditor insurance on behalf of third parties. Prior to the transaction, Ménafinance was jointly controlled by CACF and Etablissements Darty et Fils. The proposed transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité analysed the horizontal effects ( overlap in the businesses of the parties) of the transaction on the markets for consumer credit and issuance of payment cards where both Crédit Agricole Group and Ménafinance are active . The Autorité noted that, whatever the market segmentation considered, the market share of the new entity will remain below or close to 25%. The new entity will also continue to face competition from numerous competitors of comparable size, including BPCE (and its subsidiary Oney Bank), BNP Paribas (Cetelem) and Crédit Mutuel (Cofidis). The Autorité also noted that Ménafinance's activities were already well integrated within CACF prior to the transaction, as Ménafinance is part of a portfolio of CACF subsidiaries active in these markets. The Autorité also analysed the effects [1] of the transaction on the markets for the production and distribution of insurance products. It however considered that the transaction was not likely to affect competition given the low market shares of the new entity and the presence of alternative operators in these markets. At the end of its analysis of competition, the Autorité cleared the transaction without conditions.  [1] The Autorité also examined vertical effects resulting from the companies being active in markets at different stages of the value chain.  Decision 20-DCC-76 of 18 June 2020 Access the page",

On 17 August 2020, the companies Groupe Troisième Œil (GTO), controlled by Mr. Pierre-Antoine Capton, Les Nouvelles Éditions Indépendantes (LNEI) controlled by Mr. Matthieu Pigasse and NJJ Presse, controlled by Mr. Xavier Niel, notified the Autorité de la concurrence with their plan to acquire joint control of Mediawan, as part of a takeover bid launched on 30 July 2020. In addition, on 21 August 2020, Mediawan notified the Autorité of its plan to acquire exclusive control of Lagardère Studios and its subsidiaries.  Parties to the transaction NJJ Presse is a company of the NJJ group, controlled by Mr. Xavier Niel. The group is particularly active in the publishing and press sector (in particular with the press publications Le Monde, Le Nouvel Observateur and Nice Matin ) and in the provision of telecommunications services (through its subsidiary Iliad which operates the Free brand). LNEI is active in the publishing and press sector (in particular with the press publications Le Monde and Le Nouvel Observateur alongside NJJ Presse and Les Inrocks ) and in the radio sector via Novapress (Radio Nova, TSF Jazz). GTO is active in the production of flow programs (on-set television shows) and stock (fictions, documentaries). The Mediawan company, founded by Messrs Niel, Pigasse and Capton, is active in the production of audiovisual content and the publishing of seventeen pay channels (notably RTL9, AB1 and Mangas) broadcasted in France and in Europe. Lagardère Studios, a subsidiary of the Lagardère Group, is active in the production and distribution of audiovisual content in France and internationally. The Autorité considered, after analysing the cases, that the planned transactions were not likely to harm competition As the notification of the transaction relating to the joint takeover of Mediawan by NJJ Presse, LNEI and GTO preceded the one relating to the exclusive takeover of Lagardère Studios by Mediawan, the Autorité analysed the second transaction taking into account the effects of the first. The effects of the two transactions on the rights and channel publishing markets The two transactions result in an overlap of activity in the broadcasting rights markets for audiovisual programmes, with GTO, Mediawan and Lagardère Studios all producing audiovisual programmes. However, in these markets, the market shares following the two transactions are less than 25% and many competitors are active there such as production companies Newen, Banijay, StudioCanal, Elephant and JLA Group. As a result, any risk of harm to competition could be ruled out. Furthermore, due to Mediawan's activities in the channel publishing markets, the transactions also lead to a vertical overlap in the markets for broadcasting rights for audiovisual programmes, with Mediawan purchasing broadcasting rights in order to broadcast programmes on the channels it's editing. These effects could also be ruled out due to the parties' limited market shares (less than 30%), the existence of other producers able to offer audiovisual programmes to channels competing with those of Mediawan and the existence of other pay channels able to broadcast audiovisual programmes produced by competitors of Mediawan, GTO and Lagardère Studios. The specific effects of the joint takeover of Mediawan by GTO, LNEI and NJJ In the specific case of the joint takeover of Mediawan by the companies GTO, LNEI and NJJ, the transaction results in several other vertical overlaps of activity. A first overlap concerns the channel publishing activity of Mediawan, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the television service distribution activity provided by Iliad (NJJ) as part of Free's so-called \"multi-play\" internet offers. A second overlap exists between the parties' advertising activities (television advertising for Mediawan, press and online advertising for NJJ and LNEI, radio advertising for LNEI) and the activities for which the parties purchase advertising space (for example, purchase of advertising space for Free offers and Mediawan channels). However, any risk of harm to competition could be ruled out due to the parties' lack of capacity and incentive to implement foreclosure mechanisms between the various markets concerned, given the limited market shares of the new entity and the existence of competitive alternatives. For these reasons, the Autorité therefore cleared both transactions unconditionally.

        "full_text_press_realease": "On 3 June 2020, the group Fraikin [1] notified the Autorité of a plan to acquire full control of the company Via Location. The parties to the transaction The group Fraikin is active in the sector for the rental of refrigerated and non-refrigerated industrial goods vehicles through a network of around 180 agencies, 111 of which are located in France. It is also active in fleet management, the sale of used vehicles and, on the side, is a business introducer in the lease with the option to purchase sector. The group Via Location is active in the sector for the rental of refrigerated and non-refrigerated industrial goods vehicles, in France with 42 agencies, and more marginally, in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is also active in fleet management, the sale of used vehicles and, on the side, in leasing with the option to purchase. Finally, it is active in the sectors of the maintenance and manufacturing of bodywork for industrial vehicles (notably through its subsidiaries Kergroup and Giraudon). Markets reviewed The parties are mainly active in the industrial vehicle rental market. In order to analyse the effect of this acquisition of control on competition, the Autorité de la concurrence questioned the competitors of the parties to the transaction in this market. By consulting market operators, the Autorité broadened its knowledge of the structure and functioning of this market and identified the market segments requiring close analysis. Competition issues identified locally in the market for the rental of industrial goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes At the end of its analysis, the Autorité de la concurrence considered that there were risks of significant harm to competition on a local level in the industrial goods vehicle rental market, concerning industrial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. This is because, in the areas of Lens (59), Lesquin (59), Marseille (13), Nancy (54), Toulouse (31) and Valenciennes (59), the Autorité considered that, following the transaction, customers would be deprived of an adequate competitive alternative for certain types of vehicles, whether on long-term or short-term rental, since competitors would be unlikely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on the new entity. Commitments The parties submitted commitments that address these competition concerns.  The measures consist, first of all, in selling the Via Location agencies located in Lesquin (59) and Nancy (54), and, secondly, in selling a proportion of Via Location's short-term rental vehicles in the areas of Marseille (13), Toulouse (31) and Valenciennes (59) and part of Fraikin or Via Location's long-term rental contracts in the Valenciennes area (59). These measures lead to either removing the overlap in the activities of the two parties or to reducing the market share of the new entity in the areas concerned, thereby eliminating any competition concerns and ensuring a competitive dynamic both in pricing and services for professional customers in the areas concerned. In view of the commitments of divestiture undertaken by the group Fraikin, the Autorité could  clear this transaction following a Phase 1 review.  [1] In January 2017, Petit Forester decided not to take over its main competitor Fraikin. Considering the commitments submitted by Petit Forestier to be inadequate, the Autorité launched an in-depth examination. Petit Forester finally decided not to proceed with the transaction ( see press release of 19 January 2017 ). See full text of decision 20-DCC-132 of 23 September 2020 Divestiture does not mean closing agencies, but changing brand The transfers of agencies that are subject to commitments are justified by the disappearance of a local competitive pressure on the new entity at the end of the transaction. Their objective is to allow the takeover of agencies and their activity by a competitor in order to maintain competitive activity in the area concerned and thus guarantee customers a diversified offer.

The Happychic group is active in mid-range ready-to-wear, through the mixed brands Bizzbee and Happychic Stores, and those for men Jules and Brice.  The transaction is not likely to harm competition In particular, the Autorité examined whether the merger within a single entity of several brands active in women's ready-to-wear (Bizzbee, Happychic Stores, Pimkie and Grain de Malice) was likely to restrict competition on the retail distribution of mid-range clothing and accessories for women markets, in particular in catchment areas where stores of both groups are present. It noted that, in each of these areas, consumers will continue to benefit from alternative offers to the brands of the new entity, equivalent in terms of price and commercial positioning. These competing stores remain in sufficient number to prevent the new entity from being encouraged to increase the price of the items sold or to degrade the quality of the services provided in its stores.

By means of its decision of 22 July 2020, the Autorité de la concurrence had, on an exceptional basis, granted a derogation (see inset) allowing FIB to proceed with the transaction without waiting for the final decision, issued today. The parties to the transaction FIB is a French investment fund specialising in commercial property, directed by Michel Ohayon from its head offices in Bordeaux. FIB group's portfolio is mainly made up of shopping malls, office space and hotels (including the Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux and the Waldorf Astoria - Trianon Palace Versailles) in the major French cities. FIB group also works in the non-food retail market: primarily in middle-of-the-range ready-to-wear, including, in 2018, the acquisition of twenty-two Galeries Lafayette stores in the French provinces (including stores in Amiens, Cannes, La Rochelle, Rouen and Toulon) which are run as franchises. Last, FIB group is active in the toy retail sector, through Ludendo Entreprises SAS and its subsidiaries (La Grande Récré, Jouetland) with 175 stores. FIB group's turnover in 2019 was 238 million euros . The 511 Camaïeu stores operate in the middle-of-the-range women's ready-to-wear sector. Most of the clothing chain's stores are located at shopping centres or in city centres. The transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité reviewed whether FIB's acquisition of another brand in the women's ready-to-wear clothing sector was likely to restrict competition in the women's middle-of-the-range clothing and footwear retail markets, particularly in catchment areas in which the parties' stores are located close to one another. It found that, in each of these areas, consumers will continue to benefit from alternative offers to those of the parties' brands, alternatives which are equivalent in terms of price and market positioning. There are a sufficient number of these competing stores to discourage the new entity from raising the price of items sold or to reduce the quality of the services provided in its stores. The Autorité therefore cleared the transaction unconditionally.  > See decision 20-DCC-172 regarding the sole control acquisition of 511 stores of the company Camaïeu International and the Financière Brame company by Financière Immobilière Bordelaise What is a derogation from the suspensive effect? Although a merger can be finalised only after the Autorité de la concurrence has cleared the transaction, under certain exceptional circumstances, duly substantiated by the parties, the Autorité may grant an exemption allowing them to proceed with all or part of the transaction before the clearance decision has been issued, thus enabling them to pursue their business. Such a derogation is, by definition, granted only under exceptional circumstances. For example, a derogation may be granted in the case where the offer relates to the take-over of a company that has gone into liquidation or is subject to reorganisation proceedings, as in this case. The granting of a derogation by the Autorité shall not in any way prejudice the final decision taken on completing its examination of the case. Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

Bouygues Telecom had notified the Autorité on 23 October 2020 of its plan to acquire exclusive control of Euro Information Telecom (hereafter “EIT”), considered to be one of the main virtual mobile phone operators in France. EIT is a subsidiary of the Crédit Mutuel banking group, specialising in mobile telephony services. EIT obtains communication time from SFR, Orange and Bouygues Télécom and markets mobile telephony offers to the general public under five brands: NRJ Mobile, Auchan Télécom, Cdiscount Mobile, CIC Mobile and Crédit Mutuel Mobile. EIT distributes its offers, in particular, to agencies of the Crédit Mutuel group's banking network. EIT also undertakes a so-called “aggregator” or intermediary activity on the wholesale market: it markets the communication time obtained from SFR, Orange and Bouygues Télécom, to other virtual mobile telephone operators for their mobile telephony service activities provided primarily to businesses. The transaction The notified transaction comes with the signing of a distribution agreement of Bouygues offers within the network of the 4,200 bank agencies of the CIC / Crédit Mutuel group. Under this agreement, Bouygues Telecom offers will in the future, be marketed in the 4,200 CIC / Crédit Mutuel agencies. Parties are simultaneously present on the wholesale markets for access and call origination on mobile telephone networks (hereinafter, “the wholesale offer”) and on the markets for the distribution of mobile telephony products and services. The Autorité carried out an in-depth investigation in order to analyse the effects of the transaction on the structure of these markets, based on its decision-making practice, economic studies, internal documents and several studies provided by the notifying party, as well as on market tests and hearings carried out with players in the sector (competitors, customers and association of telecom operators). It also discussed with ARCEP on the impact of the transaction on the telecom markets. The Autorité considered that the transaction was likely to harm competition on the wholesale market and therefore made its clearance subject to commitments from Bouygues Telecom The Autorité ruled out any risk of harm to competition in the market for the distribution of mobile telephony products and services. However, it considered that the concentration is likely to substantially modify the structure of competition in terms of wholesale supply to virtual operators marketing their offers to businesses. In fact, the Autorité identified a risk of the disappearance of EIT offer to certain virtual operators, leading in particular to a foreclosure risk of access to this market for these operators. In order to respond to this concern, Bouygues Telecom undertook commitments aimed at ensuring, following the transaction, the maintenance of a wholesale offer equivalent to EIT's current offer.

This transaction falls within the framework of the compulsory administration proceedings initiated by the Commercial Court of Evry on 29 July 2020 with regard to the companies of Courtepaille Group. In its decision of 7 September 2020, the Autorité de la concurrence had, on an exceptional basis, granted an exemption allowing Antelope Acquisition 2 to proceed with the transaction without awaiting the final decision, which has been issued today. Parties to the transaction Antelope Acquisition 2, which is controlled by the investment fund TDR Capital, is the holding company of Buffalo Grill Group, which is a commercial restaurant chain that has 349 outlets across France, Spain and Switzerland. In addition to Buffalo Grill Group, TDR Capital owns a portfolio of several companies operating more generally in the leisure sector and, more specifically, in the catering sector (Pizza Express, Center Parcs). The scope of the acquisition by Antelope Acquisition 2 comprises 237 restaurants operating under the brand Courtepaille, which are spread across the whole of mainland France and Corsica. The transaction is not likely to harm competition The Autorité examined whether the transaction was likely to restrict competition in (i) the upstream market for the supply of food and in the downstream markets (ii) for traditional table service restaurants and (iii) for motorway restaurants. In this respect, although Buffalo Grill and Courtepaille restaurants are present at the same time in a large number of catchment areas, there is nonetheless a sufficient number of rival restaurants in each of these areas to enable consumers to continue to benefit from a large number of catering alternatives. The Autorité therefore cleared the transaction without conditions.  The full text of the decision will be published shortly on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence.

The transaction is part of a judicial liquidation procedure opened by the Paris Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) for the benefit of the Beaumanoir group. On 26 June 2020, the Autorité de la concurrence granted, on an exceptional basis, a derogation (see box) allowing the Beaumanoir group to proceed with the transaction, without waiting for the final decision, which has just been issued by the Autorité . Parties to the transaction The Beaumanoir group has clothing stores in France and abroad, primarily for female customers, operated under the Cache Cache, Bonobo, Bréal, Morgan and Vib's [1] brands. The turnover achieved by the Beaumanoir group in France is 790 million euros. The 366 La Halle stores are active in ready-to-wear for men, women and children. La Halle also operates and sells subsidiary brands, such as Liberto and Creeks, in its stores, and manages the online sales site lahalle.fr. After a thorough investigation, the Autorité considers that the transaction is not likely to harm competition In particular, the Autorité examined whether the acquisition by the Beaumanoir group of another brand active in ready-to-wear (La Halle) was likely to restrict competition in the local clothing and shoes for women and men retail distribution markets, in catchment areas where the parties' stores are present simultaneously. Depending on the area, following the transaction, some La Halle outlets will continue to operate under the La Halle brand, while others will be operated under a Beaumanoir group brand. The Autorité noted that, in each of these areas, consumers will continue to benefit from alternative offers to the parties' brands, equivalent in terms of price and commercial positioning. These competing stores - including those of the brands Kiabi, Gémo, Zara, Bizzbee, Camaïeu, Promod, Mango or H&M - remain in sufficient number to prevent the new entity from being encouraged to increase the price of the items sold or to degrade the quality of products sold in its stores.

The granting of such a derogation is, by definition, exceptional. In particular, a derogation may be granted in the event that takeover offers have been made on companies in liquidation or receivership, as was the case in the present case. The granting of a derogation by the Autorité does not however prejudge the final decision taken at the end of the investigation.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Parties to the transaction Biogroup is active in the chemical pathology sector, with laboratories spread over more than 700 sites throughout France. Oriade-Noviale is also active in the chemical pathology sector. It operates laboratories on 55 sites located in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and Bourgogne Franche-Comté. The markets examined The parties are competitors in the chemical pathology markets. Biogroup and Oriade-Noviale own medical analysis laboratories whose activity consists of providing \"routine\" chemical pathology examinations (which are examinations commonly prescribed and performed by all laboratories, such as biochemistry or haematology examinations) and specialised examinations requiring specific medical or scientific skills and specific approvals (such as genetic examinations) . They are also competitors, as purchasers, in the market for the supply of biological equipment, reagents and consumables. Biogroup is to divest eight medical analysis sites in response to competition problems identified in the départements of Isère, Rhône and Haute-Savoie While the transaction does not raise competition concerns on the upstream markets for supplies from suppliers and for specialised chemical pathology tests, the Autorité considered that there was a serious risk of harming competition on the market for \"routine\" chemical pathology tests in the départements of Isère, Rhône and Haute-Savoie. In these départements , the strengthening of the new entity's position on the market in question is not offset by a credible and sufficient alternative offer from competing operators. To maintain competitive intensity in these départements , the new entity has committed to divest the following eight medical analysis sites: The divestiture of these eight sites will remove any overlap or addition of market shares between the parties in the départements concerned. The divestiture of these sites will be carried out under a fix-it-first mechanism, which allows the Autorité to directly approve the buyer of the divested asset as part of the clearance decision. The Eurofins Group will take over the eight sites. In view of the commitments made by Biogroup, the Autorité has cleared the present transaction. It is specified that the decision of the Autorité de la concurrence is taken in accordance with the merger regulations provided for in Articles L. 430-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). It is not intended to replace any decision by the regional health agencies (ARS), whose merger control in the chemical pathology sector has distinct objectives. What is a fix-it-first type of commitment or settlement? A fix-it-first type commitment resolves competition issues in advance. In this case, it means identifying a buyer for the assets concerned by the remedy, in this case Eurofins, before the Autorité's decision is adopted.  The use of fix-it-first reduces the uncertainty and the time required to implement the commitment, as it eliminates the period of searching for and approving the buyer. The Autorité has already had recourse to fix-it-first commitments on five occasions: decision 09-DCC-67  of 23 November 2009 (LDC Volailles/Arrivé), decision 15-DCC-53  of 15 May 2015 (UGI/Totalgaz) decision 19-DCC-15  of 29 January 2019 (Dr. Oetker/Alsa) decision 20-DCC-72 of 26 May 2020 (Groupe Bernard Hayot/Vindémia) decision 21-DCC-65 of 14 April 2021 (LDC Volaille/groupe Ronsard) Decision 21-DCC-131 of 29 July 2021 Access the decision Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

Parties to the transaction DMBP, a subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group [1] , specialises in the trade of wood and panels for professionals (fitters, carpenters, joiners, landscapers, painters, etc.). Its network is organised around eight regional platforms and comprises 46 branches operating under the Dispano, CBC, Fabre & Lebeau and CIBM (Centre d'Importation de Bois) brands. Its turnover in 2020 was 380 million euros. Panofrance is active in the specialised trade in wood and panels for professionals (fitters, carpenters, joiners, landscapers, painters, etc.) and, on the eve of the transaction, was controlled by Chausson Matériaux. Panofrance operates 30 branches [2] in France, mainly located near major cities. The turnover of Panofrance in 2020 was approximately 150 million euros. DMBP is divesting of one of its outlets in response to the competition problem identified in the Tarbes area  The parties compete mainly in the market for the supply of wood and panels as customers of the manufacturers of these products and in the specialised trade in wood and panels as suppliers to professionals. While the transaction does not raise competition concerns in the markets for procurement from suppliers, the transaction leads to overlapping activities (simultaneous presence of both companies' outlets) in the catchment areas around the outlets operated by Panofrance. In most of these areas there are no competition concerns due to the presence of many competitors and a combined market share that remains below 50%. However, in the catchment area around the outlet owned by Panofrance in Tarbes (65), the new entity will control three stores with a significant combined market share for the new entity. To maintain competitive intensity in this area, DMBP has therefore committed to divest the Dispano outlet in Lons (64). The divestiture will have to be approved by the Autorité , which will ensure that the buyer is independent of the new entity and able to stimulate competition in the area for the benefit of construction professionals. An independent trustee approved by the Autorité will ensure the implementation of this commitment. Subject to this condition, the Authority has today cleared the transaction.  [1]  Saint-Gobain designs, produces and distributes materials and solutions for the construction, mobility, and healthcare markets and other industrial applications. The Group's worldwide turnover in 2020 was approximately 38 billion euros. [2] Of these 30 branches, those in Marseille, Metz and Nancy are not included in the scope of the transaction and will remain under the control of Chausson Matériaux.

        "full_text_press_realease": "On 26 October 2021, the European Commission referred to the Autorité de la concurrence the examination of the acquisition of joint control of 95 Maxi Toys stores in France by Prenatal Retail Group (hereinafter \"PRG\"), alongside Fijace ( see press release of 28 October 2021 ). The parties notified this transaction to the Autorité de la concurrence on 27 October 2021. Parties to the transaction PRG and Fijace both operate, via Distritoys, more than 250 toy superstores under the King Jouet brand, mainly in France. Maxi Toys is also a toy retailer. An initial conditional clearance decision issued in August on the acquisition of sole control of Maxi Toys by Fijace In its Decision 21-DCC-144 of 12 August 2021 ( see press release of 12 August 2021 ), the Autorité had already analysed the competitive effects of the acquisition of sole control of Maxi Toys stores by Fijace alone. In this decision, it analysed the consequences of the merger between the Maxi Toys and King Jouet distribution networks. It cleared the transaction subject to the divestiture of three stores located in Cosnes-et-Romain (54), Isle d'Abeau (38) and Saint Maximin la Sainte Baume (83). The new decision examines the joint control by Prenatal and Fijace of Maxi Toys stores and concludes that there are no new competition concerns Almost all Prenatal's activities in the toy retail distribution sector are related to its controlling interest in the King Jouet network. In this context, the Autorité has therefore ensured that the conclusions it reached in August 2021 are still valid. It also studied the effects of the transaction in four new catchment areas, taking into account the opening of four stores under the King Jouet brand name since 12 August 2021. Lastly, the Autorité completed its analysis by including overlaps between the activities of Atida, a company controlled by Prenatal's parent company, and the activities of the King Jouet and Maxi Toys networks. In view of Atida's very marginal activity in France, the Autorité considered that the transaction did not raise competition concerns other than those identified in the July decision. Since the commitments given by Fijace and New MT in Decision 21-DCC-144 were already enforceable against PRG, the Autorité considered that they did not need to be repeated in this Decision. Lastly, PRG's acquisition of a stake in Maxi Toys stores has also created vertical and conglomerate effects linked to the activity of Artsana, PRG's parent company, in the upstream markets for the manufacture and wholesaling of toys and for childcare articles. However, any competitive risk could be ruled out in view of Artsana's limited market share in these markets. The Autorité has thus unconditionally cleared the transaction. > The full text of the decision will soon be uploaded onto the Autorité's website  Vertical effects are examined when the transaction brings together players present at different levels of the value chain. Conglomerate effects are likely to occur when the new entity expands or strengthens its presence in markets that are different from those in which it is active, but whose connectedness may allow it to increase its market power.

Chemical pathology products Chemical pathology products include the instruments and reagents that make it possible to obtain medical information from biological samples taken from the patient and analyzed by biological laboratories, including hospitals. The exclusive agreement signed between bioMérieux and Guyane Service Médical Through an exclusive distribution agreement signed in 1995, bioMérieux has entrusted the distribution of its chemical pathology products to Guyane Service Médical (GSM) in several territories, including French Guyana. Thus, GSM was the only distributor of bioMérieux laboratory products in French Guyana for many years. The « Lurel Act » bans any exclusive import agreement since March 2013 The Overseas Economic Regulations Act of 20 November 2012, known as the “Lurel Act” banned concerted agreements or practices regarding unjustified exclusive importing into overseas collectivities as from 22 March 2013.Yet, the exclusive distribution agreement between bioMérieux and GSM was not modified before 26 August 2016, more than three years after the deadline. Throughout this period, GSM has remained de facto and de jure the only company likely to supply bioMérieux products to the laboratories. Practices which prevented the laboratories to benefit from competition By marketing its products in French Guyana through a wholesaler-importer with exclusive rights, bioMérieux has prevented competition for the laboratories on its products between local distributors. As for GSM, it was able to avoid any competition from third-party distributors. Although exclusivity practices only applied to the French Guyana territory, they focused on essential products of medical biology that play a decisive role in medical decision-making and patient care. As a result, the Autorité fined GSM, the main beneficiary of the practice, 150,000 euros, and bioMérieux 75,000 euros. The de facto exclusivity observed after 2016 does not result from a concerted practice After 26 August 2016, GSM remained de facto the sole distributor of bioMérieux products. However, it follows from the investigation that this de facto exclusivity no longer derives from an agreement or a concerted practice but from the specific nature of the products concerned. It is the constraints specific to the distribution of these products that explain the privileged use of the long distribution circuit (taking into account the strict transport and storage conditions of the products), and the particular functioning of the relevant market (specialization of distributors by brands and types of products). importations exclusives : les décisions précédentes It is the sixth decision issued by the Autorité de la concurrence regarding exclusive import practices in the overseas territories: Press release of 8 October 2018 Press release of 20 February 2018 Press release of 27 July 2017 Press release of 6 July 2016 Press release of 10 September 2015 Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

One company, Sécurité Vol Feu, refused the settlement. The DGCCRF thus refered the case concerning this company to the Autorité de la concurrence , in accordance with Article L.464-9 of the French Commercial Code. The safeguarding of tobacconists In order to protect themselves from criminal acts, tobacco store owners regularly employ specialized companies to secure their facilities. They can thus benefit from public aid, which covers part of the cost of the work, providing that the owner submits two invoices to the public authorities issued by two competing companies. The issuing of cover quotes The investigation showed that between March 2013 and April 2014, Sécurité Vol Feu exchanged confidential information with a competitor in regard to, especially, prices of services and respective clients in order to set up cover quotes and thus divide the markets concerned. A practice that contributed to a misuse of public funds By skewing, via the issuing of cover quotes, the competition process required by regulations, the Sécurité Vol Feu company breached competition law and contributed to the misuse of public funds.  The Autorité de la concurrence fined the Sécurité Vol Feu company 46 000 euros. The issuing of a cover quote consists, for a company, in asking another company – presented as a competitor – for an offer with a much higher amount, in order to be certain to obtain the concerned tender.  > See the text of Decision 18-D-05 of 13 March 2018 regarding practices implemented in the safeguarding of tobacconists in the Isère départements > Press contact : Chloé Duretête - 0033 1 55 04 01 20 / Email > See decision of the cour d'appel de Paris (20th December 2018 )",

Concerned sector is the overseas distribution of consumer goods , such as fresh or not feed products, beverages, household and personal care products, and cosmetics sold under manufacturer brand. This decision is the first by which the Autorité publicly releases a general settlement with all the companies involved in a same case, given that none of them made a statement of objection. The fine is divided as follows: €250,000 for Henkel, €210,000 for importers of Henkel products in La Réunion, €140,000 for importers of Henkel products in the Antilles and Guiana, and €15,000 for the importer of Henkel products in the Wallis-and-Futuna Islands. In 2015, the Autorité had obtain commitments from several industrial players In its decision 15-D-14 of 10 September 2015 ( see press release of 10 September 2015 ), the Autorité de la concurrence had implemented the provision of the Lurel Law which prohibited exclusive imports. It then accepted that companies Pernod-Ricard, Danone, Johnson&Johnson and Bolton Solitaire submit commitments, leading to the termination of the proceedings. The very early proposal from these companies to organize a call for applications in order to select non-exclusive importers overseas had enabled the commitments procedure to be implemented without fines. First settlement decision In the case of contracts between Henkel and its wholesalers, the extension of exclusive import contracts beyond the date set by the law, namely 22 March 2013, led the Autorité to hand down fines. This first decision is a signal sent to all overseas wholesalers or companies selling products in these territories which henceforth must avoid going back to exclusive import practices of any kind, which frow now on will be severely repressed. In this case, companies involved have not issued a statement of objection and have been able to benefit from the new settlement procedure introduced in 2015 by the Law of 6 August 2015 for Growth, Activity and Equality of Economic Opportunities, known as the « Macron Law ». Present decision therefore establishes a precedent. Procedural advantages allowed by the settlement are illustrated by the brevity of the decision, which takes notice of the compromise elaborated with each company without giving details of the negotiations that led to an agreement. The respect of confidentiality on the modalities and conditions of the settlement is a guarantee for the companies which will engage in this procedure in the future. Concerned brands are, among others : Mont Saint-Michel, Syoss, Schwarzkopf, Palette, Vademecum, Denivit, Teraxyl, Diadermine, Le Chat, SuperCroix, Xtra, Mir, Minidou, Bref, Decapfour, Terra, Loctite, Patex, Rubson Loctite, Rubson. > See full text of decision 16-D-15 of 6 July 2016 on practices implemented in the distribution of consumer goods overseas. > Press contact: Aurore GIOVANNINI / Tel.: + 33 1 55 04 01 81/  Email",

The online tax and accounting data transmission portal created by the Ordre des experts-comptables Beyond a specific turnover threshold, companies are obliged to report specific taxes, such as VAT and corporate taxes, to the tax administration via remote transmission. In matters of data filing, companies usually commission either their chartered accountants – who certify their accounts and/or tax returns – or the OGAs, tasked with the certification of tax returns. In practical terms, the latter use an online portal, which they can access via data entry accounting software. There are several portals, including “ jedeclare.com ” that was created by the Ordre des experts comptables and marketed through the ECMA Association. In order to make their portal indispensible, the Ordre des experts-comptables and ECMA have entered into partnerships with accounting software publishers and with OGAs, and they proposed to the latter a pricing offer for portal services, in breach of competition rules Through the signature of a charter, “ jedeclareexclusive ”, accounting software publishers had to undertake to promote and recommend exclusively the “ jedeclare.com ” portal to their chartered accounting customers and not to propose competitor portals. They also undertook to technically integrate, in their software packages, the interface and solutions of the “ jedeclare.com ” portal with as much incentive as possible “ to convey all reporting flows through jedeclare.com ”. Some OGA federations, on the other hand, signed partnership contracts and a charter stating that the signatory federation “ undertook to promote the use of the jedeclare.com portal, above any other, to its members (...) ”. In return, the OGAs that were members of a signatory federation benefitted with no objective justification, from more favourable tariffs than those proposed to OGAs members of a non-signatory federation. A flat-rate pricing offer, which constituted tied selling, was also provided for, so that OGAs, as soon as they received flows from the “ jedeclare.com ” portal (incoming flows: accounting and tax returns), would use the same portal to send their own flows (outgoing flows: certificates and mission summary reports). A strategy aiming to foreclose the demand of the portal's users The investigation showed that these clauses, which aimed at restricting competition at the expense of other portals and users, fell within a deliberate strategy to drive these portals from the market. The preamble to the contracts concluded with software publishers stated indeed that the contract had a view, notably, to “ prevent multiple other offers from emerging, as it would create confusion for accounting professionals ”. In the same way, the Conseil Supérieur de l'Ordre des Experts-Comptables (National Association of Chartered Accountants – hereinafter CSOEC) wrote, in the November 2009 internal magazine for chartered accountants, that the “ jedeclare.com ” portal had been created “ in order to make chartered accountants simply indispensable, to keep full control over the value-added information generated within their practices and to complement a legal monopoly with a de facto monopoly ”. As it was, because contracts were signed with the three main accounting software publishers, the unified action of the Ordre des experts-comptables and the ECMA was most efficient: access to about 75% to 85% of the market for software users – including most of the chartered accountants' costumers – was made more difficult for the portal's competitors. Moreover, access, by competitors, to the OGAs' demand, became more difficult (and expensive) because of the fixed pricing policy. The parties, that did not challenge the facts, obtained a fine reduction Neither the Ordre des experts-comptables nor the Association challenged the facts that were reproached to each of them. Moreover, they made various commitments. Here are the main ones: To put an end to the promotion and use exclusivities that bind them to accounting production software publishers within the framework of the “ jedeclareexclusive ” charter's application on the one hand, and within the framework of bilateral contracts on the other.    To stop applying the partner pricing offer to the promotion of the “ jedeclare.com ” portal, but instead link it with the implementation of a training plan, laid out over three years, on the development of dematerialisation, for chartered accounting practices and for the OGA's employees.    To redress the tied selling practices, by subjecting partner tariffs, applicable to certificates and mission summary reports issuance services, to separate invoicing.    The Ordre des experts-comptables will not grant any more subsidies, whatever their nature, to the ECMA for its business linked to the “ jedeclare.com ” portal.    Finally, the CSOEC and ECMA undertook to adopt an antitrust compliance programme in order to prevent the rise of new anticompetitive practices (appointment of a “competition representative” entrusted with the mission to set up the programme; training and increasing staff awareness to competition rules; internal prevention and warning mechanisms against anticompetitive practices). Since they did not challenge the objections and, more particularly, because they undertook to set up an antitrust compliance programme, the Ordre des experts-comptables and the ECMA obtained a fine reduction of 22% respectively.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Conseil de la concurrence accepts commitments by jeweller Festina France and closes litigation procedure >Version française  In its decision dated 24th July 2006, the Conseil de la concurrence has noted and accepted the commitments of Festina France, considering that they meet the competition concerns raised. Although Festina refuses that its products be marketed by companies selling exclusively on the Internet, Festina has committed itself to amend its framework distribution agreement in order to integrate clauses relative to online sale and to propose to members of its network a contract specific for online sale on the Internet. History of the case Bijourama, a company specialized in the sale of time pieces, jewels and silversmith's pieces exclusively on the Internet, submitted a referral to the Conseil de la concurrence on October 13th 2005. The referral was accompanied by a request for interim measures.  Bijourama complains about the refusal of Festina France to grant its approval so as to integrate its selective distribution network for watches. Bijourama considers that this refusal is discriminatory towards “pure internet sellers” and that in all cases, Festina France's selective distribution agreement is not lawful since it excludes a certain form of distribution, and that would be prohibited both by EU and domestic law. Competition concerns : the gap in the law of Festina France's distribution agreement as regards Internet sale During the hearing (25 January 2006), the Conseil's case officer expressed competition concerns.  The case officer considered that the framework selective distribution agreement set up by Festina France did not contain any provision governing Internet sale and that no agreement specific for mail-order selling existed otherwise. As a result, Bijourama could not ask for the implementation of mail-order selling rules and Festina France could not use either its distribution agreement in order to justify its refusal to give its consent. Moreover other distributors had been granted the permission to sell on the Internet outside any legal framework applicable to this type of sale. The absence of rules applicable to online sale of Festina France's products, whereas some informal and particular authorizations for online sale have been granted to already approved distributors having an outlet, seems likely to create discriminations and even competition restrictions, as regards distributors' conditions of approval inside the selective distribution network as well as conditions under which network members may use Internet sale. Commitments offered by Festina While challenging the validity of the referral, Festina France offered commitments consisting in amending and completing its selective distribution agreement in order to integrate from now on clauses concerning Internet sale reflecting the conditions relative to sale in stores. Festina however maintained its refusal to approve companies selling exclusively on Internet.  The integration of these clauses will enable all members of the selective distribution network, and any company likely to join, to know the acceptance criteria and the exact conditions for online sale. Impact of commitments  The Conseil accepted the commitments, considering that they satisfied its own competition concerns, given the position of Festina France on the market and despite the fact that they do not entirely satisfy Bijourama.  The Conseil stresses the fact that the decision to accept commitments is not aimed at satisfying the request of a party or replying to an individual need but to protect economic public order.  In the case in point, the Conseil noted that EU regulations governing selective distribution did not prevent a selective distribution network operator – whose market share does not exceed 30%- to define freely the selection criteria of its distributors and thus to reserve Internet sale exclusively for its network members which have a store. However the criteria applied to them should be transparent, non-discriminatory and should not restrict the use of this type of advertisement or sale, which the new distribution contracts of Festina France should ensure from now on. > Decision n° 06-D-24 of July 24th2006, relative to the request for interim measures presented by Bijourama > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (16th October 2007)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence fines the manufacturers Philips, Sony and Panasonic a total of 34.4 million Eurosfor imposing a compulsory minimum retail price scheme on their distributors. Following a referral by the firm Avantage (trade name TVHA), the Conseil de la concurrence handed down a decision on the merits of the case on 5th December. In its decision, the Conseil penalized the consumer electronics manufacturers Philips, Sony and Panasonic for entering into a vertical agreement with each of their distributors in an attempt to fix the retail prices of their branded brown goods. It imposed fines totalling 34.4 million Euros: · Philips France: 16 million Euros · Sony France: 16 million Euros · Panasonic: 2.4 million Euros The facts denounced In 1997, the company SARL Avantage marketed brown goods under the trade name TVHA in its store in the city of Grenoble. The name TVHA was particularly associated with discount prices, lower than those practised by the other retailers. The company Avantage claims to have encountered difficulties in its dealings with certain suppliers and wholesalers, on the grounds that it practised prices lower than those recommended by the suppliers. These difficulties apparently began when Avantage launched an active advertising campaign in the press. The complainant company alleged that suppliers and distributors of consumer electronics goods had entered into minimum price fixing agreements, and also claimed that certain suppliers and wholesalers had attempted to evict it from the market. The setting up of a vertical agreement between the manufacturers Philips, Sony and Panasonic and their respective distributors The investigation and the case elements show that Philips, Sony and Panasonic respectively set up a system to control the prices practised by their distributors, in an attempt to ensure that they complied with the \"recommended' prices. The Conseil de la concurrence took the view that there was serious, precise and corroborating evidence of an agreement between the manufacturers Philips, Sony and Panasonic and their respective distributors. In particular, it took into account the following evidence: · the communication of \"recommended\" retail prices to wholesalers and retailers · the observed alignment in the sale prices of a number of products sold by all the distributors of the brands concerned (with, for example, one particular model of television set found to be on sale at the same price in all the retail outlets, with just a few exceptions) · the existence of monitoring and retail price control mechanisms (with telephoned warnings from manufacturers or wholesalers to \"boost prices\", visits to retail outlets by regional representatives of the brand, and threats to halt deliveries or reduce the financial conditions offered to retailers) · the existence - in the case of Philips and Sony - of co-operation agreements between their retailers, by which the manufacturers were able to control their pricing and advertising policies Serious practices and damage to the economy The practice of entering into an agreement in order to introduce a system for fixing prices in a market, notably by delaying or suspending deliveries to any distributor who fails to comply with these imposed prices, is a serious offence. In the case in point, the agreement penalized by the Conseil deprived consumers of the chance to acquire electronic equipment made by Philips, Sony and Panasonic at a more attractive price, which would have been the result of real price competition between distribution networks. The Conseil emphasised that these practices are particularly serious, in that they were implemented by major international groups, whose behaviour is likely to represent the norm for the sector. Lastly, the Conseil took into account the fact that the practices were implemented by the sector's three biggest manufacturers. Between them, over the period 1998-2002, they accounted for 55% of total hi-fi sales, almost 50% of television sales and nearly 40% of DVD player and VCR sales. Similar objections, stated against the companies Toshiba and Yamaha on the same grounds, were rejected by the Conseil due to a lack of evidence. See the decision (05-D-66)",

        "full_text_press_realease": " In a decision dated 24th July, 2003, the Conseil de la concurrence imposed sanctions on laboratoires SANDOZ (which has now become NOVARTIS Pharma SA) for abuse of a dominant position, and fined them a sum of 7.8 million Euros. Laboratoires Sandoz' monopoly in the cyclosporin market Laboratoires Sandoz manufacture and market amongst others two proprietary medicinal products. These products, Sandimmun® and Néoral®, are both patented and are based on the same active ingredient, cyclosporin. They are prescribed in hospitals in anti-rejection treatment for organ and bone marrow transplants. At the time of the events in question (between 1994 and 1997), all hospitals obtained these proprietary medicinal products, which were considered to be essential for the treatment of transplant patients. In 1996, sales of cyclosporin to French hospitals generated a turnover of 400 million Francs for laboratoires Sandoz, which accounted for over half of their total sales (710 million Francs) to hospitals. The practices sanctioned From 1994 onwards, laboratoires Sandoz introduced a sales policy intended to increase customer loyalty among hospitals via a system of linked reductions. The abusive practice involved granting reductions on the purchase price of an essential medicinal product, namely cyclosporin, on condition that the hospital also purchased other Sandoz products, even if cheaper alternatives were available from competing companies. The seven products concerned were: Vépeside®, Sandocal®, Miacalcic®, Loxen®, Icaz®, Leponex® and Parlodel®. The Conseil de la concurrence took the view that laboratoires Sandoz, which held a dominant position in the market for cyclosporin, marketed in France under the brand names Sandimmun® and Néoral® had abused that dominant position in the markets concerned through the sale of the seven aforementioned products. As a result of this practice, Sandoz's competitors were eliminated on twenty-four occasions, in calls for tender issued by eight different hospitals. The hospitals in question were in Besançon, Caen, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Montpellier, Saint-Etienne, Toulouse and Tours. Seriousness of the practices and damage to the economy When judging the seriousness of these practices, it is important to take account of the fact that they were carried out by a company with a monopoly in a particularly large market. At the time of the events in question, cyclosporin was indeed an innovative and essential medicinal product, since it led to a significant rise in the number of transplants performed during the period concerned. In this light, it is serious that laboratoires Sandoz abused their position of strength in relation to hospital pharmaceuticals purchasers, by taking advantage of their market monopoly in order to artificially impose their other medicinal products, despite the availability of competing products. The seriousness of the damage caused to the economy lies in the fact that at the time, cyclosporin was the product that accounted for the highest expenditure in hospital budgets. In addition, increases in the price of cyclosporin introduced during the period in question significantly exceeded the reductions granted. Finally, the markets for seven other medicinal products were also affected, and the practices took place over a period of three years. Moreover, it is worth noting that the medicinal products that Sandoz attempted to force out included generic products available at prices substantially lower than those of original products. > Decision n° 03-D-35 dated 24th July, 2003, relative to practices implemented by laboratoires Sandoz (which became Novartis Pharma SA in 1997) in the market for certain medicinal products intended for hospitals > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (30th March 2004) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 28th June 2005",

        "full_text_press_realease": " Following a referral by the companies Sonera France (now Fonecta) and Scoot France, the Conseil de la concurrence imposed fines totalling 40 million Euros as part of breach of injunction proceedings. The injunctions issued  In its decision 98-D-60 dated 29th September 1998 (Filetech case), the Conseil de la concurrence issued injunctions against France Télécom for abuse of a dominant position on the market for trade in telephone subscriber lists, and imposed fines. After having set aside the decision of the Conseil for procedural reasons, the Paris court of appeal issued almost identical injunctions in its decision dated 29th June 1999. On 4th December 2001, the Cour de Cassation (Supreme Court) rejected France Télécom's appeal against this decision. The Paris court of appeal thus ordered the company France Télécom : \"- to provide the complete list, including information contained in the universal directory, to any person requesting it, under identical conditions, subject to the rights of the persons concerned, - to offer a service under which files containing nominative data held by third parties can be brought into conformity with the so-called \"orange\" list of telephone subscribers, irrespective of whether or not the said files are directly drawn from the directory information base ; […] these services must be offered under transparent, objective and non-discriminatory conditions, at a price reflecting costs resulting from the technical operations needed to meet this demand […]\". The complaints lodged by Scoot and Sonera The companies Scoot and Sonera referred breach of injunction proceedings to the Conseil de la concurrence , for failure to respect the injunctions issued by the Paris court of appeal. Citing the need to access the list of telephone subscribers in order to exercise their activity, they contest the tariffs imposed on them by France Télécom. They also consider that these tariffs prevent them from achieving economically viable development. The company Sonera France, which was founded in January 2000, wishes to position its offer on telephone information with added value. Its activity clearly enters into competition with the service proposed by France Télécom, \" le 12 \". The company Scoot France, which was founded in February 2000, wishes to develop an \" intelligent directory \" service, via telephone and Internet. Offers for access to France Télécom's directory information base France Télécom proposes two offers to this type of operator: On-line data access (consultation) via Intelmatique Sale of its entire directory information base The decision of the Conseil de la concurrence The Conseil de la concurrence examined these breach of injunction proceedings in two stages : In decision 02-D-41 dated 26th June 2002, it judged that the company France Télécom had failed to adhere to the injunctions pronounced against it by the Paris court of appeal in its decision of 29th June 1999, on the following two points : - the prices demanded for consulting the directory information base via the services offered by the company Intelmatique do not reflect costs ; - the sale prices of directory information […] for users wishing to provide an information service but who do not wish to publish printed directories, are discriminatory compared with those practised within the France Télécom group itself ; With respect to the demand that tariffs for France Télécom's activity as file manager must reflect costs, which was also included in the court of appeal's injunction, the Conseil referred the dossier to inquiry on this point. An expert was appointed. However, the Conseil indicated in its decision that the costs referred to were solely those specific to the activities of constituting and managing the universal directory (incremental costs): since France Télécom is unable to exercise its own activity without establishing a commercial file for its subscribers, there are no grounds for the company to pass on the costs common to both its directory management and sales activities to its competitors in the directory and information market. In its decision 03-D-43 of 12th September 2003, in light of the conclusions of the expert report and following inter partes proceedings, the Conseil de la concurrence judged that France Télécom failed to adhere to the injunction requiring that the tariffs practised for the activity of file manager should reflect costs. The appointed expert carried out a comparison between the turnover resulting from France Télécom's file management activity, and the incremental cost of constituting the directory information base. This comparison revealed a clear disparity : Comparisons with other countries, in particular Great Britain, show that the tariffs practised by the historical operators, in some cases after intervention by the industry regulator, are substantially lower than those practised by France Telecom. On the basis of these elements, the Conseil de la concurrence handed down fines against France Télécom for breaching the injunction requiring that its file management activity should reflect costs, as well as for two other practices already established in decision 02-D-41 and those mentioned above. Seriousness of the practices In order to appreciate the seriousness of the practices in question, the Conseil took into consideration the fact that: France Télécom, which had been warned as early as September 1998 (decision 98-D-60) about the excessive nature of the prices invoiced to operators for accessing information contained in the universal directory list, must have been aware that these practices were illegal, as confirmed by the subsequent decisions of the Paris appeal court and the Cour de Cassation (Supreme Court). Despite the injunctions issued by the court of appeal and since that date, it took none of the measures necessary to provide these services in a non-discriminatory fashion and at a price reflecting the costs resulting from the technical operations required to meet the demand. these excessive prices created an artificial entry barrier to the markets downstream, and prevented the development of activities competing with those of France Télécom, in particular directory and information services. In this respect, the Conseil notes that these practices, to the detriment of consumers, hindered both the lowering of prices of the services concerned and the appearance of innovative services, which would have been encouraged by the free play of competition. > Decision n° 03-D-43 of 12th September 2003, relative to respecting the injunctions issued against the company France Télécom by the Paris court of appeal in its decision dated 29th June 1999 > Decision n° 02-D-41 of 26th June 2002, relative to respecting the injunction issued against the company France Télécom by the Paris court of appeal in its decision dated 29th June 1999 > Decision n° 98-D-60 of 29th September 1998, relative to practices implemented by the company France Télécom in the sector for sale of telephone subscriber lists > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th April 2004) following the appeal lodged against the decision n°03-D-43 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (29th June 1999) following the appeal lodged against the decision n° 98-D-60",

        "full_text_press_realease": " The Conseil de la concurrence fines France Télécom and SFR for implementing anticompetitive pricing practices (decision 04-D-48) For the future and as part of moves to introduce new regulations in the telecommunications sector, the Conseil has issued the ART (French Telecommunications Regulation Authority) with a favourable opinion on ex-ante regulation in this market (opinion 04-A-17) As part of litigation proceedings concerning pricing practices implemented between 1999 and 2001, the Conseil has fined France Télécom €18M and SFR €2M*  Following a referral from the professional association TENOR (which has now become ETNA), the Conseil de la concurrence took the view that France Télécom and Cegetel, vertically integrated operators in the fixed and mobile telephony markets, had implemented “price scissor” practices between 1999 and 2001. Via their respective fixed telephony divisions (France Télécom and Cegetel), the offending parties offered retail \" landline to mobile \" services to medium-sized firms and \" major accounts \", at prices that were not compatible with the call termination charges (CTCs) practised by their respective mobile telephony divisions (FTM, which has since become Orange, and SFR). France Télécom offered companies a range of Itinéris \" landline to mobile \" services, at tariffs that did not cover the variable costs incurred for the supply of these services (including the CTC set for its mobile network). The same applied to the SFR \" landline to mobile \" offers proposed to companies by Cegetel. This practice is known as \" price scissoring \". It involves an operator, which is usually vertically integrated, setting both retail prices on a market and the intermediary service price paid for access to the retail market, without leaving a sufficient difference between the two to cover the other costs incurred for supplying the retail service. The Conseil considers that such a practice has the aim and effect of distorting competition, since it can lead to other operators being excluded from the market. In the case in point, the practices of which the two companies were accused had the effect of restricting the emergence of competition on this market, and delaying the interconnection of alternative fixed telephony operators: operators entering the fixed telephony markets were unable to offer companies competitive offers for services between landlines and Itinéris or SFR mobiles via a direct interconnection to the FTM or SFR networks, without incurring losses.  These practices were all the more damaging, in that they took place at a key time, when alternative operators had no choice but to opt for the direct interconnection solution. International rerouting techniques ( tromboning ) had ceased to be an alternative solution in April 1999, whilst \" hedgehog \" type solutions (whereby calls from landlines are rerouted via mobiles) were only really put into practice in the first six months of 2002.  However, the Conseil considered that Bouygues Télécom was not in a position to distort competition on the downstream market for calls from fixed networks to mobiles. It took into account the fact that Bouygues Télécom is not an integrated operator, and that its share of the call termination market is very low. Bouygues Télécom is only present on the downstream \" landline to mobile \" market on a virtual basis, via private networks placed under the responsibility of client companies. The fixed telephony offers which form the object of the referral only concerned communications from landlines to Bouygues Télécom by those companies, which were already clients. Due to their limited nature, the Conseil took the view that they could not have distorted competition. *The offence was attributed to the group's parent company which, at the time of the facts, was the Cegetel group. In 2003, the company Cofira absorbed the company SFR before merging with the Cegetel group, which subsequently changed its corporate name to SFR. Consequently, the offending practice can now be attributed to SFR. > Decision 04-D-48 relative to practices implemented by France Télécom, SFR Cegetel and Bouygues Télécom As part of moves to introduce new regulations in the telecommunications sector, the Conseil de la concurrence has issued the ART (the French Telecommunications Regulation Authority) with an opinion, in which it declares itself favourable to ex-ante regulation in the market for termination of calls on the Orange, SFR and Bouygues Télécom mobile networks.  The Conseil has issued the ART with this opinion as part of the consultation process required under article L. 37-1 of the French code of posts and electronic communications. This code was laid down by the law of 3rd June 2004 relative to electronic communications and audiovisual communication services (which itself transposed the \" telecoms package \" into French law). This first consultation concerned the delimitation of relevant markets, and dominant situations in the wholesale market for termination of voice communications on mobile networks in France.  This market has developed on the basis of pricing imbalances resulting from the “bill and keep” system (whereby mobile operators do not bill each other for call termination on their networks). This set-up has led to ineffective technical solutions, intended to avoid invoicing the termination of \" landline to mobile \" calls (\" hedgehogs \"). The Conseil took the view that this state of affairs has not allowed competition to develop sufficiently for the benefit of the consumer.  The “bill and keep” system is set to disappear in the near future, whilst virtual mobile operators are expected to expand considerably. However, these two factors alone seem unlikely to create effective competitive pressure on call termination charges by 2007, the year to which the Conseil 's market analysis extended. Given these conditions, the Conseil would be happy to see the causes for the current imbalance eliminated, with alternative operators moving to direct interconnection.  Such a migration will require substantial investment and numerous negotiations with mobile operators. To ensure that it is carried out smoothly, the Conseil believes that a transitional phase is required for re-orienting the market. It also believes that ex ante regulatory instruments appear more suited to managing this migration than ex post instruments. The Conseil de la concurrence takes the view that such regulations can be applied to the three mobile operators (Orange, SFR and Bouygues Télécom), each of which exert a significant influence on their respective wholesale call termination markets in mainland France. The ex ante regulations must be limited in time and must be based on instruments that are in strict proportion to the nature of the obstacles identified in the competitive market analysis. This is the first opinion of its kind, issued as part of regulatory reform in the telecommunications sector. Similarly, at the ART's request, the Conseil will be required to issue opinions on 17 other \" potentially regulatable \" markets predefined by the European Commission. > Opinion 04-A-17 relative to a request for opinion submitted by the Autorité de Régulation des Télécommunications (Telecommunications Regulation Authority), in application of article L. 37-1 of the French code of posts and electronic communications    > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (12th April 2005) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) (10th May 2006) > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (2nd April 2008) >See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) (3rd March 2009) > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (27th January 2011) > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (Supreme Court of Appeals) (17th January 2012)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "> Version française  At the conclusion of a case which started in 2001, following a complaint from the company VIIV (Vedettes Inter-îles Vendéennes), regarding the pricing practices used by the Vendée region's local authority-run sea transport corporation Régie départementale des passages d'eau de la Vendée (which has since become the Yeu Continent company), the Conseil today announced its decision, stating that it had found no proof that these practices were anticompetitive. The practices questioned The Régie départementale provides a regular crossing service, with two ferries and one “vedette” passenger boat, between La Fromentine and the Isle of Yeu. VIIV, which runs a passenger boat service between two ports in the Vendée region and the Isle of Yeu during the summer season, accused the Régie départementale of having fixed the price of crossings on its vedette, “L'Amporelle” at very low levels, below its actual cost price. It claimed that a company with a public services responsibility, which uses its dominant position to distort competition in a competitive market, by practicing predatory pricing, was contrary to the terms of article L. 420-2 of the code of commercial law, which prohibits abuse of a dominant position. A seasonal market The Conseil noted that the Régie départementale is the only company offering a ferry link on the Isle of Yeu – mainland route and therefore enabling the transportation of vehicles and bulky merchandise. It also noted that, during the winter period, it is the only company offering passenger crossings on this route, in accordance with its public service mission. The Isle of Yeu is a popular tourist destination in summer and in the summer season (April to September), the Régie départementale finds itself in competition with several other companies offering express passenger crossings. L'Amporelle's prices are not anticompetitive To determine whether its prices are “predatory”, these must be compared with the company's costs. Based on EC case-law (COMP/35.141 – Deutsche Post), the Conseil determined that, in this case, the costs to be taken into account for this calculation should be limited to its “ incremental ” costs, i.e. those which the Corporation would not bear if it were not involved in competitive activity. The Conseil determined that it should: Include only those costs linked to the running of l'Amporelle during the summer season , as this is the only period during which the Régie départementale is involved in a competitive activity     Exclude fixed costs linked to the purchase of the passenger boat and which the Régie départementale is obliged to bear in any case, to provide its public service mission , regardless of whether l'Amporelle remains in dock during the summer or is involved in a competitive activity. Finally, as a result of this calculation, it was proven that the costs specifically generated by the express passenger boat, l'Amporelle's crossings from April to September are covered by the prices charged by the Régie départementale . It is not therefore proven that the Régie départementale abused its dominant position and attempted to push out its competitors. The Conseil specified that this analysis is based solely on a strict evaluation of conformity under competition law and does not prejudge either the economic efficiency conditions within which the Régie départementale provides its public service (notably the choice of size of its vessels), or the value of the local authority subsidy to cover its public service expenses, as it is not competent to evaluate this. > Decision 04-D-79 of 23 December 2004, relating to practices implemented by the Régie départementale des passages d'eau de la Vendée (RDPEV) corporation > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (28th June 2005) and correcting decision dated 17th January 2006 > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) of the 17th June 2008 and correcting decision dated 14th October 2008 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (9th June 2009) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 13 July 2010",

Construction of the “Estuaries Road”, said A84, required 79 new engineering structures in the Manche département alone. The Conseil was asked to investigate illegal agreements concerning the building of 51 such structures (bridges, underpasses and hydraulic structures on the River Sienne), for which the département 's planning authority ( Direction Départementale de l'Equipement ) launched a number of restricted calls for tender at the beginning of 1995. The Conseil de la concurrence established that 21 companies participated in a very large-scale agreement, engaging in illegal practices such as exchanging information prior to submitting bids, submitting covering bids and offering compensation to companies which agreed to abstain from bidding, resulting in the contracts being divided up. Given the serious nature of the practices concerned, the Conseil de la concurrence decided to impose fines totalling 17.3 million Euros. > Decision 05-D-19 of 12th May 2005, relative to practices implemented during the awarding of contracts to construct civil engineering structures on the A84 motorway, known as “Estuaries Road”, in the Manche département > See ruling of the Paris Court of Appeal (13th September 2005) > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (7th March 2006) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 6th March 2007",

Between 1996 and 1998, the State and local and regional administrations launched a number of calls for tender, inviting companies to bid for contracts to carry out works on various civil engineering structures, roads, drinking water supply and drainage installations across the département. Market sharing The Conseil de la concurrence observed that the companies Céréda H, Nicora, SEETP, Sotrae, Berthold and Monti held regular meetings prior to the deadline for submitting bids, at which they agreed to divide previously the various contracts up between them. Specifically, the first four companies met on 5th November 1996, to divide up the contracts for Lerouville, Saint-Mihel, Bar le Duc, Fouchères and Trémont. Information exchanged prior to bids For eight contracts in the region, the companies Céréda, EJL Est, Axima (Colas Est), Berthold, Eurovia, Nicora, Sade, SEETP Robinet, Sotrae, SRE and Müller, in various combinations, exchanged information before submitting bids. In some cases, they agreed to submit covering bids to cover other companies. The public procurement agent deceived Finally, the companies Céréda Henri and Céréda Frères engaged in an anticompetitive agreement by submitting what they claimed were competing bids, when in fact they had not been drawn up independently. Serious practices penalized by the Conseil de la concurrence Regarding the practice of exchanging information prior to the submission of bids, the Conseil takes the view that such horizontal agreements and concerted actions - which are intended to share markets - are particularly serious . Furthermore, it emphasizes that such actions are likely to mislead public institutions about the existence or intensity of competition. The Conseil observed that some of the companies guilty of engaging in these practices - for example Axima (Colas group), Eurovia, EJL Est (Vinci group) and Sade CGTH (Vivendi Environnement group) - are large national firms and are attached to major groups. As such, they may have had an impact on smaller businesses and distorted the rules on competition for contracts to carry out works on various civil engineering structures, roads, drinking water supply and drainage installations in the Meuse département. Lastly, when assessing the damage caused to the economy, the Conseil took into account: · the number of contracts for which evidence of agreements was produced (i.e. 13 contracts) · the average amount of the contracts concerned, i.e. 440,000 Euros · the price rises observed in these contracts due to the reduction of competition in the département. In light of the seriousness of these practices, the Conseil de la concurrence decided to fine the companies concerned a total of 7 million Euros . > Decision 05-D-26 of 9th June 2005 relative to public works markets in the Meuse département > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (25th April 2006) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 6th November 2007",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Conseil de la concurrence fines Royal Canin and distribution network a total of 5,000,000 Euros. Following a referral from the Minister of Economy regarding practices by the company Royal Canin and its distribution network, the Conseil de la concurrence has penalized Royal Canin for abusing its dominant position in the market for the sale of dry dog food in specialist stores, and for having instigated a series of anticompetitive vertical agreements with the members of its distribution network. The anticompetitive practices observed concern solely the specialist distribution network, including wholesalers, cash and carries and retailers, and affect both intra-brand and inter-brand competition. The dog biscuit market in specialist stores The Conseil considered that the sale of dry dog food in specialist shops represents a relevant market, in which Royal Canin achieves a major portion of its turnover, and in which it distributes advanced or top-of-the-range products not available in mass retail outlets. The Conseil also determined that Royal Canin held a dominant position in the market between 1998 and 2000, given its market share and the nature of the market: · Royal Canin held a market share of 39 % in 1998, 41 % in 1999 and 42 % in 2000. · The market concerned was a brand market, where high investments are major barriers to entry. Furthermore, some of these brands were indispendable: Royal Canin actually owned two of the three top brands distributed in specialist stores: the leading brand \"RCCI Size\" and the third-ranked called\"Sélection\". · Royal Canin had an undeniable advantage over its competitors with its long-standing presence in the flagship sector for nutritional products. · Besides, the other competitors in the market had substantially smaller shares, with the highest around 10%. Foreclosure of intra-brand competition Royal Canin set up a network of 19 distributors throughout France, to distribute its products. These products were distributed in 13,000 specialist outlets, providing the brand with an incomparable presence in the market. Relations between Royal Canin and its distribution network were formalized with specific contracts – “Service partnership” contracts. Customer restriction agreements Royal Canin's sales policy kept mass market distribution and the specialist distribution sector perfectly separate, thus prohibiting any intra-brand competition. The exclusivity agreements signed by Royal Canin and its distributing wholesalers obliged them to restrict distribution exclusively to the specialist distribution sector, professional breeders and vets. Royal Canin's top-of-the-range biscuits were therefore totally absent from the mass market at the time of the events, and the dry dog food brands were destined exclusively for one or the other sector. Sale prices imposed on wholesalers and the existence of a system controlling the agreement Royal Canin also imposed resale prices via its “Service Partnership” agreements on its wholesalers and ensured these were respected through a system of feedback – a real system controlling the agreement. The effects of these practices on the market concerned As a result, any retailer wishing to purchase Royal Canin's products was unable to take advantage of competition between suppliers, and had to deal with the wholesalers appointed by Royal Canin, at the single set price. This lack of intra-brand competition contributed to an increase in retailers' supply costs. Given the substantial market share held by Royal Canin within the specialist sector, these practices obviously affected a major share of the intermediary market, and, therefore, the downstream market segment. Moreover, some products, which are considered essential, were only present in this sector. Retail prices imposed on the end customer The Conseil considered that Royal Canin was responsible for instigating a series of vertical anticompetitive agreements within the retail market, notably with the aim of imposing sale prices on consumers. The price checks carried out for the purposes of the investigation (over 1,000) revealed an alignment in sale prices to consumers for the Royal Canin nutritional brands RCCI Size and Premium. The Conseil noted that Royal Canin established and published indicative retail prices which, in fact, were fixed retail prices. These prices were then passed on to retailers by the wholesalers and franchisers, then scrupulously implemented by retailers. Foreclosure of inter-brand competition through loyalty discounts The Conseil also judged the system of loyalty discounts implemented by Royal Canin to be anticompetitive. The company awarded discounts at the end of each year to some members of its network – and notably franchisers' cash and carries, i.e. passed on to retailers in the end – depending on their turnover and/or tonnage of Royal Canin products sold. The Conseil pointed out that the discount schemes implemented by Royal Canin, which acted as a very strong incentive, could only be met by competitors through disproportionate efforts. When implemented by a company in a dominant position, this sort of system tends to prevent new competitors from entering the market, as it requires a competitor wishing to take market share from Royal Canin to reduce its prices considerably and endanger its economic stability. The penalties imposed by the Conseil de la concurrence The Conseil therefore penalized Royal Canin for anticompetitive agreements with its distribution network, and for its price practices in both the wholesale and retail sectors. It also penalized the company for abuse of dominant position, due, on the one hand, to its imposed pricing practices and customer restrictions, and on the other hand, to its loyalty discount practices for cash and carries and retailers. It therefore imposed the following penalties: • on the company Royal Canin, a fine of € 2,500,000; • on the company Normandie Loir Distribution, a fine of € 89,000; • on the company Sodiamal, a fine of € 1,000; • on the company Sodegal, a fine of € 24,000; • on the company Cazenave, a fine of € 37,000; • on the company Ferrat, a fine of € 71,000; • on the company Garibaldi, a fine of € 29,000; • on the company Fapac-Tivadis, a fine of € 34,000; • on the company Rhonaldis, a fine of € 98,000; • on the company Alpadis, a fine of € 60,000; • on the company Canidis, a fine of € 65,000; • on the company Tripode, a fine of € 210,000; • on the company Truffaut, a fine of € 1,500,000; • on the company Delbard, a fine of € 279,000; • on the company Les Jardins de Pacy, a fine of € 4,000; • on the company Idéal Canin Valdoie, a fine of € 1,000.",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence fines the Decaux Group 10 million Euros for breach of injunctions. Context of the case The Conseil de la concurrence has penalized the Decaux Group for breaching certain injunctions handed down against it in 1998 (Decision n° 98-D-52 of 7th July 1998), and has imposed fines totalling 10 million Euros on the Group's companies. In its 1998 decision, the Conseil took the view that the companies of the Decaux Group had abused their dominant position in the market for the supply of street advertising furniture. Although on that occasion it did not impose any fines, it handed down a number of specific injunctions requiring the group to cease its abusive practices. These injunctions ordered the Decaux group: · to stop offering local and regional administrations wishing to sign contracts with it to include a clause granting the Decaux group company a right of priority for the installation of further street furniture; · to stop offering local and regional administrations wishing to sign contracts with it to include a clause stating that certain equipment installed during the contract period has a distinct contractual duration from that of the contract; · to stop offering local and regional administrations wishing to sign contracts with it to include that contracts with local and regional administrations should contain a tacit renewal clause. · to inform the local and regional administrations with which the Decaux group has signed contracts of any modifications made to the standard clauses in the contracts it offers. The Conseil de la concurrence observed that the Decaux Group companies had only partially adhered to its injunctions Firstly, the Conseil took the view that the companies of the Decaux Group had failed to fully adhere to the injunction requiring them to abandon the \"right of priority\", by continuing to include provision in certain contracts for the installation or possibility of installing new street furniture, without submitting to competition. It also considered that the companies of the Decaux Group had failed to fully comply with the injunction concerning contract periods, since in certain contracts they had included expiry dates for equipment that differed from the expiry date of the contract itself. Lastly, the Conseil observed that the companies of the Decaux Group had failed to implement the terms of the injunction concerning information for local and regional administrations. On the contrary, it found that the companies had given the administrations statements which were false or were intended to deter them from obtaining compensation for the anticompetitive practices observed. However, the Conseil did note that the Decaux Group had complied with the injunction regarding the tacit renewal clause. Breach of injunctions: a serious practice justifying heavy penalties Breach of injunctions handed down by the Conseil is a particularly serious practice, as indicated recently by the Paris court of appeal in its ruling of 11th January 2005. In the case in point, the breach of injunctions had the effect of closing down competition in the market for the supply of street advertising furniture to local and regional administrations, allowing the Decaux Group to keep holding a virtual monopoly in the market concerned. Consequently, the Conseil has decided to impose the following fines: · on the company JC Decaux SA, a fine of 6,400,000 Euros; · on the company JC Decaux Mobilier Urbain, a fine of 2,750,000 Euros; · on the company SOMUPI, a fine of 250,000 Euros; · on the company SOPACT, a fine of 170,000 Euros; · on the company SEMUP, a fine of 430,000 Euros;",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence fines the companies Kéolis, Connex and Transdev 12 million Euros for entering into an anticompetitive agreement. Following a referral by the Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry, the Conseil de la concurrence has issued a decision, penalizing the companies Kéolis, Connex and Transdev for entering into a nationwide anticompetitive agreement between 1996 and 1998. The purpose of the agreement was to divide up public transport markets (urban bus services) during calls for tender launched by local and regional administrations (collectivités publiques). The public passenger transport sector: an oligopolistic market dominated by three major groups Demand for public passenger transport is driven by the authorities that organize transport, i.e. local and regional administrations, associations of local authorities, urban districts or town and municipal communities. Three major national and international groups share the majority of the French market: · the company Kéolis (formerly VIA-GTI), which at the time of the facts was owned by the bank Paribas (70%) and the Vivendi group (12%) · the company Connex (formerly CGEA Transport), which at the time of the facts belonged to the Vivendi group · the company Transdev, a subsidiary of C3D, itself a subsidiary of the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations group. A national cartel It was observed that the directors of these national and international transport companies formed a cartel, with the intention of dividing up the French national market for public passenger urban transport. Under the rules of conduct adopted by the cartel, the three companies in question refrained from competing whenever a contract held by any of them came up for renewal. Under the aegis of the cartel, the companies were able to exchange markets where there was an objective advantage for their own interests. They were also able to divide up markets by means of subcontracting services. These anticompetitive practices enabled the companies to impose their prices on local and regional administrations. Consequently, when granting concessions for the running of their transport networks, the administrations were forced to bear higher costs than if the market had been open to competition. Numerous local markets affected by the agreement This national agreement, organized by parent companies, which closely monitored the activity of their subsidiaries, clearly affected local public transport contracts in Bordeaux, Bar-le-Duc, Epernay, Laval, Chalon-sur-Saône, Saint-Claude, Oyonnax and Sens. In these towns and cities, during calls for tender, the companies agreed to refrain from submitting tenders, or to withdraw existing tenders, or to submit tenders that did not threaten the incumbent contract holder. In doing so, they deceived the local and regional administrations concerned about the real state of competition. Extremely serious practices justifying exemplary penalties The formation of a cartel in an oligopolistic market, and the resulting monopoly rent (in this case financed by administrations' public funds), is one of the most serious anticompetitive practices. A national cartel of this kind is, by definition, likely to have a substantial impact on intracommunity trade, by virtue of its magnitude and its very purpose: to prevent competitors, whether national or foreign, from winning contracts. The offence is all the more serious for being committed by some of the most well-known groups in France, as it sets a very poor example. As such, it justifies particularly heavy penalties on the companies concerned. Consequently, the Conseil de la concurrence decided to impose the maximum fines allowed under the version of the French code of commercial law (code de commerce) in force at the time of the facts (i.e. before the New Economic Regulations Act came into force): · the company Kéolis was fined 3,900,000 Euros; · the company Connex was fined 5,050,000 Euros; · the company Transdev was fined 3,000,000 Euros .

        "full_text_press_realease": "Publishing decision 05-D-58, relative to practices observed in the drinking water sector in Ile-de-France, the Conseil de la concurrence draws the attention of the region's local administrations to the importance of introducing real competition into the upstream market for water supply. The specific nature of the water supply market in Ile-de-France The water production market is dominated by three operators: the Syndicat des eaux d'Ile-de-France (Sedif) with 37% of the market, the Société anonyme de gestion des eaux de Paris (Sagep) with 33%, and the Lyonnaise des Eaux group with 19%. Between them, these three companies cover 90% of the Ile-de-France region's water needs. There is a great surplus in water production in the Ile-de-France region, since twice as much water is produced than is consumed. This surplus is far in excess of the margin generally needed to guarantee the security of supply and cover consumption peaks in summer. In addition, water producers' networks are interconnected by primary or secondary pipelines, mainly to allow emergency supply where necessary. The water suppliers do not offer any wholesale water sale prices to consumers located outside their respective distribution zones. This prevents the formation of wholesale prices by market mechanisms. The market remains therefore partitioned between the various zones controlled by each producer. Municipalities or associations of municipalities are either small and only own the terminal portion of the distribution networks that serve them, or they form large integrated companies who grant contracts for management of the entire production and distribution chain they own to one of the two biggest operators: CGE (Compagnie Générale des Eaux) for Sedif and Sagep (north side of the Seine), the Lyonnaise des Eaux group for Sagep (south side of the Seine). Although all the technical conditions (resources and interconnections) needed for the creation of a wholesale water supply market are satisfied, the market is still partitioned between the different zones controlled by each producer. In the absence of a wholesale market, there can be no competition between water producers when concession contracts are awarded for water distribution, and it is very rare for a concession to be awarded to a company other than that which produces the water. Municipalities have a special role to play in introducing greater competition into the market for the supply and transportation of water. The Conseil insists that municipalities in the Ile-de-France region have, from now on, the option to separate the water supply market from the water distribution market when they call for competing bids for new public service water distribution concessions. By unbundling the two markets in this way, municipalities would be able to access the cheapest water resources available, thereby benefiting their users, whilst also taking advantage of the best distribution services on offer. Indeed, municipalities are within their rights to: cease working exclusively with the wholesale water supplier which holds the monopoly for the medium-flow network serving their area; and unbundle their public service concession contracts, when they are put up for renewal, by separating the wholesale water supply aspect from the local distribution service in the municipality. The behaviour of Lyonnaise des Eaux illustrates clearly and concretely the means by which an operator with a de facto monopoly for the supply of water, has succeeded in winning a concession contract for water distribution from a public association. The Lyonnaise des Eaux group offered the Syndicat du nord-est de l'Essonne (NEE) a wholesale water price - for supply alone - that was some 17% higher than the price offered in its global \"supply + distribution\" bid. This amounts to a tied reduction, which was clearly intended to handicap any competing bid for distribution only, since it enabled Lyonnaise des Eaux to act in a discriminatory manner, offering a price lower than that offered as part of its separate wholesale bid. Meanwhile, the behaviour of the Syndicat des eaux d'Ile-de-France shows how an operator with a de facto monopoly for the supply of water acted to prevent any opening, even temporary, in the wholesale water market. Sedif deliberately put pressure on the final negotiations for a water supply contract between one of its main clients, Semmaris (the company managing the Rungis National Interest Market) and its competitor, Sagep, which was prepared to deliver wholesale water supplies to the Rungis National Interest Market at a price 22.5% lower.

        "full_text_press_realease": "In November 1999, the company Neuf Télécom referred to the Conseil de la concurrence regarding practices implemented by France Télécom in the wholesale market for broadband Internet access (ADSL). In February 2000, the Conseil subsequently ordered France Télécom to propose a new technical and commercial offer, that would enable other operators to compete effectively in the market. In May 2004, the Conseil observed that France Télécom had breached the injunction, and fined the company a total of 20 million Euros. The fine was subsequently doubled by the Paris court of appeal (see inset below). Now called upon to rule substantively on the merits of the case, the Conseil de la concurrence has decided, in light of the seriousness and duration (1999-2002) of the practices concerned, to fine France Télécom 80 million Euros for preventing its competitors from accessing the wholesale ADSL Internet market, until October 2002. In December 1999, France Télécom refused a request by Neuf Télécom concerning access to the wholesale broadband Internet market. ADSL technology, which was launched in 1999, has resulted in the appearance of several new markets: the provision of broadband Internet access via ADSL, the routing of ADSL traffic between subscribers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by operators. However, France Télécom held a monopoly on the copper lines (the local loop) that link subscribers to the telephone exchange, and the local loop was not actually unbundled until 2002. As a result, competing operators who wanted to provide ISPs with these routing services were forced to buy wholesale services from France Télécom, in order to be able to take delivery of ADSL traffic at an intermediate point on the incumbent operator's network. The Conseil observed that France Télécom had agreed to offer Internet Service Providers (ISPs) these wholesale services, provided they were implemented entirely in its own installations (option 5). However, France Télécom refused to allow competing telephone operators, like Neuf Télécom, the possibility to partly use their own installations instead, according to the conditions set out in option 3. In doing so, it prevented the competitors from making wholesale offers to the ISPs. France Télécom then agreed to permit its competitors to replace France Télécom's installations by theirs(option 3), but at prices that prevented them from making the ISPs offers that were competitive with those made by France Télécom under option 5. The Conseil observed that whilst option 3 was eventually proposed at prices enabling competing operators to put together offer for ISPs under economically acceptable conditions, this did not take place until September 2002, after the ART (the French Telecommunications Regulation Authority) obtained concomitant price reductions for all France Télécom's offers, options 3 and 5. The Conseil took the view that France Télécom's refusal of Neuf Télécom's request, and the inappropriate conditions it subsequently proposed, amounted to a refusal of access to the local loop and the installations located between this loop and the connection points under option 3. It also considered that the loop and the associated installations constituted an essential infrastructure, since the loop had not yet been unbundled. By refusing access to an essential infrastructure in this way, France Télécom was able to remain the sole supplier of services routing broadband Internet (ADSL) traffic between subscribers and ISPs until 2002, whilst preventing potentially more innovative and efficient competitors from entering the market. The ISPs were unable to take advantage of competition in the market and were therefore deprived of more attractive technical or price conditions, which they could have passed on to consumers. The Conseil took the view that these practices were extremely serious and had caused significant damage to the economy. It considered that France Télécom's anticompetitive practices: led to the closure of the market for broadband Internet (ADSL), thereby guaranteeing that France Télécom remained the sole ADSL wholesale supplier; persisted for almost three years, and this despite the injunctions handed down by the Conseil and the warnings issued by the ART (which has since become the ARCEP) between January 2001 and October 2002, concerning the anticompetitive nature of the practices; were committed by a vertically integrated incumbent operator, which owned an essential infrastructure necessary for the establishment of broadband services by competitors. Due to its position, France Télécom therefore had a special responsibility in the broadband market, since it was able to alter the structure unilaterally; took place in an emerging market, and served to hold back that market's vitality. When calculating the fine, the Conseil took into account the fine already imposed on France Télécom for the aforementioned breach of injunction. Story of the case Decision of 18th February 2000 ordering interim measures  Following a complaint by Neuf Télécom, the Conseil took the view that France Télécom's refusal to allow third party operators to develop their own competing broadband Internet access offers had caused serious and immediate damage to the sector. The Conseil consequently ordered France Télécom to alter its behaviour immediately, whilst awaiting a full decision on the merits. It ordered France Télécom \"within a maximum period of eight weeks[...], to propose to third party operators a technical and commercial offer giving them access to the permanent virtual circuit for the provision of Internet access via ADSL, or any other equivalent technical and economic solution allowing operators to exercise effective competition, both in terms of prices and in terms of the nature of services offered\". In a ruling dated 30th March 2000, the Paris court of appeal upheld the Conseil's decision. Decision of 13th May 2004 observing breach of an injunction handed down as an interim measure Observing that the injunction handed down as an interim measure had gone unheeded, the Conseil fined France Télécom 20 million Euros for breach of injunction. Although on 18th April 2000, France Télécom had indeed sent the third party operators an offer called \"ADSL Connect ATM\", the offer in question contained a number of technical and price restrictions and, consequently, breached the Conseil's injunction. In a ruling dated 11th January 2005, the Paris court of appeal upheld the Conseil's substantive analysis on the merits, but doubled the fine from 20 to 40 million Euros (pending an appeal with the Cour de cassation, French Supreme Court of Appeal).

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence rules that the Cistercian monks of the Isle of Saint Honorat did not ignore competition law by restricting passenger transport to and from the island exclusively to a company under their control. In a decision dated 8th November 2005, the Conseil de la concurrence has rejected, on the grounds of insufficient evidence, the referral handed down by the company Trans Côte d'Azur in July 2005, together with the accompanying request for interim measures. Background The Lérins Isles lie to the south-east of La Croisette, some 800 metres off the coast of Cannes. They are made up of two larger islands, Sainte Marguerite and Saint Honorat, and two small islets: la Tradelière Saint-Féréol. The Isle of Saint Honorat is peculiar in that it is in private hands, owned entirely - with the exception of certain areas that are classed within the Public Maritime Domain – by the Cistercian Congregation of the Immaculate Conception (Congrégation cistercienne de l'Immaculée Conception). This religious community, which comprises around thirty monks, runs guest quarters, which is an economic activity, and produces and sells a range of consumer goods. During the day, it hosts visitors attracted by the charm and tranquillity of the island and the abbey-church. The Congregation also holds a concession for the sole landing stage that exists to allow access to the island, and grants exclusive use of the stage to its subsidiary company Planaria, which thus holds a monopoly on transport to and from the island. The complaint by Trans Côte d'Azur Trans Côte d'Azur is a subsidiary of the company Société Nouvelle de Remorquage et de Transport Maritime (SNRTM), which is based in Toulon. Set up at the beginning of the 1990s to develop the parent company's activity in France's Alpes Maritimes département, Trans Côte d'Azur was until 1996 based in Nice, where it ran a mainly tourist oriented pleasure boat trip business with regular shuttles to the Lérins Isles, which was subsequently extended to Saint Tropez, the Bay of Villefranche and Monaco. Having moved its base of operations to Cannes in 1996, until 1999 Trans Côte d'Azur offered several passenger routes departing from the old port of Cannes, including regular year-round links with the Isle of Saint Honorat. Trans Cote d'Azur claims that the Congregation is abusing its dominant position, by reserving transport to and from the island exclusively for the company Planaria without admitting any competition, and refusing access to the island's sole landing stage, to the detriment of the complainant and all the other companies which served the island prior to 1999. Trans Côte d'Azur emphasizes that these practices have served to restrict competition, since no ferry company other than Planaria now directly serves the Isle of Saint Honorat, or even simply lands there as part of a tourist excursion service combining this island with nearby Sainte Marguerite island, even though they all continue to serve Sainte Marguerite. The Conseil de la concurrence took the view that the monopoly on transport to and from the island met an objective necessity The Conseil de la concurrence took the view that by reserving the monopoly on passenger transport to the island, the Congregation had extended the monopoly it holds concerning passengers wishing to visit the island's private monastery area, to those passengers who would only want to visit the public part of the island. However, after examining the arguments put forward by the Congregation, it concluded that the creation of the Planaria transport company and the monopoly on transport to and from the island met an objective necessity, justified by the site's peculiar geography, the private character of the island and the need to control the flow of visitors. The Congregation's aim of limiting visitor numbers is justified by the need to conserve, across a relatively small area, the peace and tranquillity of the monastery site and safeguard the integrity of the listed site. Past attempts to open up routes to the island to several competing companies resulted in excessive numbers of visitors, especially during the summer period (2,000 to 3,000 visitors per day), which is incompatible with the aforementioned objectives. If other private companies were authorised to land at the island's sole landing stage, the only way of regulating visitor numbers would be to introduce a policy of quotas for each company. This system would be difficult to implement, since it would mean not only introducing passenger quotas, but also time slots at which each company could land, on account of the small size of landing stage n° 14 (135 m2). It would also be difficult to enforce, given the geography of the site. The Conseil de la concurrence therefore took the view that no other possible solution could satisfy the same objectives with fewer competition restrictions, and that consequently the referral should be rejected.",

In the light of a special report on Parisian luxury hotels, shown as part of the television programme Capital on French channel M6, the Conseil de la concurrence began proceedings ex officio on 4th December 2001, to examine the state of competition in the luxury hotel sector. Searches and seizures were also carried out by the DGCCRF at the six luxury hotels featured in the report. On the basis of this investigation, the Minister of Economy also referred the matter to the Conseil on 6th January 2003. After investigating the case, the Conseil de la concurrence decided to penalize the six Paris hotels, which are known as \"palaces\" for their grandeur, the Bristol, the Crillon, the George V, the Meurice, the Plazza Athénée and the Ritz, for having regularly shared confidential information about their respective commercial activities. Given the oligopolistic nature of the market in question, the Conseil took the view that these practices had distorted competition by promoting a collusive equilibrium. A regular system for sharing information The investigation revealed that the six luxury hotels had regularly exchanged confidential information about their respective activities, and also about certain elements needed to put together their respective marketing plans. These exchanges took place in the form of regular meetings and e-mail correspondence. The information was shared weekly and monthly on past activities, but in some cases also included business forecasts. The Paris luxury hotel market: a distinct oligopolistic market In addition to the fact that the regular exchanges of information were restricted to the six establishments concerned by the investigation, a number of material elements were found to confirm the existence of a specific market for Paris luxury hotels, distinct from the four-star hotel market. The establishments concerned by the investigation are the only luxury hotels in the French capital to offer a combination of certain qualitative features: a prestigious location in the centre of Paris, a high proportion of suites, some of which are exceptional, a gourmet restaurant, outstanding on-site facilities (swimming pool and/or fitness centre), and a large staff on-hand to cater for guests. The luxury hotels clearly differ from their four-star counterparts in terms of their price scheme, which reflects their prestige and the level of service they provide, and also their average price, which is an indication of their ability to sell a large number of overnight stays at a very high price. The average rate for a room is over €700 per night, with the cheapest costing more than €500 and the most expensive prestige suites costing in excess of €6,000 per night. In an oligopoly, sharing strategic information helps to create a collusive equilibrium, by artificially raising the transparency of the market for the exclusive benefit of the parties to the practice concerned The information exchanged enabled the luxury hotels to monitor one another effectively by sharing details of their performances and following each other's developments very closely. The way in which certain luxury hotels used the information exchanged indicates that this was indeed their aim: some of the documents seized include charts used to evaluate the competitive position of each establishment, by calculating theoretical market shares and measuring the gap between these shares and the results achieved by each hotel. By sharing this information, the luxury hotels were able to ensure that their respective performance levels did not differ too greatly, and that none of them was seeking to adopt strategies likely to endanger the positions held by the other members of the oligopoly. Fines The Conseil de la concurrence imposed the following fines: Bristol: €81,000 Crillon: €248,000 George V: €115,000 Meurice: €55,000 Plaza Athénée: €106,000 Ritz: €104,000 In the same decision, the Conseil de la concurrence set aside another objection that had been stated to the same luxury hotels, accusing the establishments concerned of entering into an agreement regarding joint promotional offers (\"shopping with Parisian palaces\", \"Best of Paris\"). The Conseil took the view that these joint promotions, the impact of which was very limited, had no effect on the market. See the decision (05-D-64)",

The Conseil has fined the three mobile telephony operators, Orange France, SFR and Bouygues Télécom, for engaging in two kinds of anticompetitive agreements that distorted market competition. The practices were revealed as part of an investigation carried out following the Conseil 's decision to begin proceedings ex officio on 28th August 2001, and a referral handed down by the consumer association UFC Que Choisir on 22nd February 2002. The fines amounted to a total of 534 million Euros: Orange France: 256 million Euros SFR: 220 million Euros Bouygues Télécom: 58 million Euros Sharing strategic information on new subscriptions and cancellations Every month between 1997 and 2003, the mobile operators exchanged detailed and confidential information on the numbers of new customers signed up the previous month, and the numbers of people who opted to cancel their subscriptions. The Conseil considered that, although the operators' decision to share this information had no bearing on their future pricing strategies, it was nonetheless likely to reduce competition in the mobile phone market for several reasons: First, the operators could not have gained access to this type of data if they had not systematically shared it, in an arrangement which they were careful to keep secret. It should be noted that ARCEP (the French Telecommunications Regulator) has never published this information, merely a general overall indicator of total new acquisitions and cancellations, monthly until 2000, and subsequently only quarterly from April 2000. \t Second, it is clear from the minutes of the three operators' various executive committees, that the developments in these indicators were an extremely important source of information, and were taken into account when determining commercial strategies. On a market which is difficult to penetrate and comprising only three operators, information sharing of this kind is likely to distort competition, by reducing uncertainties over competitors' strategies and diminishing each company's commercial independence, particularly where - as has been the case in the mobile telephony market since 2000 - growth in demand is slowing substantially. In addition, the Conseil observed that from 2000 onwards, the operators' sharing of information enabled them to monitor the separate agreement they had reached on the development of their respective market shares. Agreement between the three operators from 2000 to 2002 to stabilize their market shares based on jointly-defined targets It was also found that between 2000 and 2002, the three operators entered into an agreement aimed at stabilizing the development of their respective shares of the market. The Conseil uncovered a number of pieces of serious, specific and corroborating evidence pointing to the existence of such an agreement. These included handwritten documents with explicit references to an \" agreement \" between the three operators, the \" pacification of the market \" and the \" Yalta of market share \". Certain similarities were also observed in the commercial policies implemented by the operators during this period, particularly in terms of acquisition costs and call rates. It was these similarities that led UFC - Que Choisir to hand down its referral, focusing on the operators' simultaneous decision at the beginning of 2001 to start charging for calls in 30-second increments, after the minimum first minute. In the medium term, this collusion served to maintain the three operators' share of new subscription sales at relatively stable levels, and also paved the way for them to alter their strategy from 2000 onwards. Up until then, the mobile operators had relied on acquiring market share to ensure their growth, which required considerable investment. From 2000 onwards, a period which coincided with the end of the race to acquire market share, the three operators simultaneously adopted strategies aimed at consolidating their existing customer bases. This led, among other things, to a hike in prices and the adoption of measures such as giving priority to contracts with commitments over pay-as-you-go cards, or the introduction of billing per 30-second increments after a minimum first minute. These measures, which were against the interests of the consumer, could clearly have led to a drop in sales (and therefore market share) for any operator who took the step of introducing them unilaterally. The collusion was therefore intended to make it easier for the operators to introduce this strategy, by enabling them to ensure that they all adopted the same policy simultaneously, and that their market shares would consequently remain stable. Particularly serious practices and substantial damage to the economy Concerning the sharing of information \tThe Conseil took into account the length of time over which the practices took place (from 1997 to 2003) and the very considerable size of the market in question. It emphasised that the damage caused to the economy by the artificial creation of anticompetitive transparency in the market varied with time, with greater damage caused in the post-millennium period than before 2000. Indeed, from 2000 onwards, the existing information sharing agreement allowed all three operators to monitor the progress of the \"market pacification\" policy they had adopted, to the detriment of consumers. \t Concerning the market share agreement \tLike other competition authorities, the Conseil de la concurrence regards market sharing agreements as unjustifiable, and therefore among the most serious of their kind. \tThe damage to the economy must be assessed in the light of the three-year duration of the practices and the sheer size of the market concerned. It is also worth noting that the agreement took place in a market to which entry was highly restricted, since mobile telephony operators are required to obtain a licence and no MVNO was granted access to the operators' networks during the period in question. \tThe Conseil took into account the fact that since the late 1990s, mobile telephones have come to represent a new expense for households, and now account for significant portion of their budgets. It also considered that by colluding, the operators were more easily able to introduce measures that were against the interests of consumers.  See the decision (05-D-65)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence imposes fines totalling 33.6 million Euros on six building and civil engineering companies specializing in the supply of bituminous material. Following a referral from the Minister of Economy, on 15th December 2005 the Conseil issued a decision in which it imposed penalties on several building and civil engineering companies, for engaging in a complex and continuous agreement during the awarding of public roadworks contracts in the Seine-Maritime département . Between 1991 and the end of 1998, the companies concerned, which have since become subsidiaries of the Bouygues, Vinci and Eiffage groups, along with some smaller firms, entered into an agreement to share the tonnages of bituminous material to be spread on category 1 and 2 highways in the département . Market for the supply of bituminous material in Seine-Maritime To build roads, building and civil engineering companies use bituminous material, which is heavy and difficult to transport. The process by which the material is manufactured also results in a certain amount of pollution, and is subject to administrative authorization. The cost of manufacturing the material makes up approximately 80% of the total cost of roadworks, whilst the cost of transporting it is estimated at around 10%. The difficulties and costs of transporting bituminous material effectively restrict the pertinent market for this product to a radius of around 40km around the plant where it is manufactured. The plants in Seine-Maritime likely to be involved in the contracts concerned by the referrals, between 1988 and 1998, were concentrated around Dieppe, Le Havre and Rouen. The Conseil observed that, at the time of the offending practices, Seine-Maritime invested more than any other French département in highways. Market sharing The Conseil de la concurrence established that several building and civil engineering companies - which have since become Colas, Eurovia, Gagneraud Construction, Le Foll Travaux publics, Appia, Buquet - agreed on a scale for sharing the tonnages of bituminous material needed for roads in Seine-Maritime. That scale was then applied to all contracts with the State and the département 's General Council ( Conseil Général ). The figures provided by the General Council prove that this market sharing scale, which allowed tonnages of bituminous material to be distributed between the parties to the agreement, was applied between 1992 and 1998, along with regular mutual checks on the application of the quotas and compensation mechanisms designed to ensure compliance. The Conseil also established that the offending companies regularly exchanged information on prices prior to submitting tenders. The system ended in 1999. The public procurement agent deceived The Conseil established that the manner in which the companies answered public calls for tender had an anticompetitive objective. The companies systematically submitted tenders in groupings, despite the fact that there was no economic or financial justification for the companies to group together in this way. The purpose of this approach was to allow the companies concerned to share the tonnages of bituminous material between them, according to the predetermined scale. The Conseil demonstrated that the companies acted in a number of ways to prevent competitors from disrupting the agreement. The instigators of the agreement financed lawsuits filed by several supposed environmental protection groups against the company Buquet. The aim was to prevent Buquet from building a bituminous material manufacturing plant that would enable it to compete with the parties to the agreement for public contracts in Seine-Maritime. When the lawsuits failed, the companies that were party to the agreement organized a meeting in September 1997, in order to include Buquet in the market sharing agreement. Buquet's actions helped to bring about the end of the agreement in 1999. According to established case law, the Conseil considers that the deliberate and sustained deception of the public procurement agent during various calls for tender is a particularly serious practice. Damage to the economy The Conseil considers that the damage to the economy comes from the fact that this practice lasted for at least eight years and the prices applied during this entire period were substantially higher than those that would have resulted from free and undistorted competition. Based on the theoretical scenario in which the least damage was caused to the economy, it appears that the Seine-Maritime General Council was overcharged by approximately 24.8 million Euros between 1992 and 1998 (162M FF), which equates to an average of 3.54 million Euros per year. In addition, the Rouen SRPJ (financial section) and the DGCCRF were given an official commission to compile reports on the case, in 2002 and 2004 respectively. According to these reports, the economic damage for the period 1988 - 1998 was evaluated at between 350 and 400 million FF for the General Council's contracts alone. Consequently, when the system came to an end in 1999, the average cost of a tonne of bituminous material fell by 30%. The fines imposed by the Conseil company Colas Ile de France Normandie: 21,000,000 Euros company Eurovia Haute Normandie: 2,800,000 Euros company Gagneraud Construction: 6,500,000 Euros company Le Foll Travaux publics: 2,900,000 Euros company Appia Haute Normandie: 400,000 Euros operating company Buquet: 60,000 Euros See the decision (05-D-69)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence fines the companies BVHE, Casino, Carrefour and SDO for engaging in vertical price agreements. Following a referral from the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, the Conseil de la concurrence has issued a decision, in which it imposes penalties on the company BVHE (Buena Vista Home Entertainment), the exclusive distributor of Disney video cassettes in France, the retailers Casino and Carrefour and the wholesaler SDO (Selection Disc Organisation), for engaging in a price fixing agreement on the retail price between 1995 and 1998. The Conseil decided to impose the following fines: · BVHE: 3.1 million Euros · Carrefour SAS: 5.7 million Euros · Casino Guichard Perrachon: 3.2 million Euros · SDO: 2.4 million Euros BVHE entered into an agreement with the retailers Casino and Carrefour, along with the wholesaler SDO, for fixing the retail price of Disney video cassettes The company BVHE instigated a vertical agreement with the retailers Casino and Carrefour and the wholesaler SDO, with the aim of fixing the retail price of Disney video cassettes at an artificially high level. This practice was complemented by a common policy on collecting, sharing and monitoring information aimed at consolidating the system. The effect of the agreement was to raise the retail prices of Disney children's video cassettes in all the stores concerned to the same level. Most of the retailers' margins became back margins, without sufficient justification Under legislation prohibiting \"below-cost selling\", only discounts and rebates that are free of conditions can be included in calculations to determine the below-cost selling threshold, and thus taken into account when deciding the retail price. BVHE and the retailers concerned abused this legislation for their own advantage. By negotiating with retailers a set of discounts and rebates with false conditions (i.e. the discounts were assumed not to have been acquired at the time of invoicing), BVHE artificially raised the retailers' below-cost selling thresholds, which mechanically led them to raise their own retail prices. This practice effectively maximized the profits made by the producer and the retailers, to the detriment of the consumer. Serious practices that deprived the consumer of the opportunity to take advantage of competitive prices The Conseil emphasised that the offending practices were particularly serious, insofar as they deprived consumers of the opportunity to acquire the products concerned at a lower price, i.e. that which would have resulted from proper price competition between the distribution networks. It takes the view that these practices were all the more serious, since they were committed by a major international group (Disney), whose behaviour is likely to set the standard for the sector. The company also occupies a very strong position on the market concerned, since Disney video cassettes are in constant demand. In determining the amount of the fines, the Conseil de la concurrence also took account of the fact that the offending practices were based on an abuse of the legislation prohibiting below-cost selling, and that they were partially committed by retailers who claim to have aggressive pricing policies. Negotiated settlement procedure and commitments The fines imposed on BVHE and Carrefour were reduced by approximately 25% and 40% respectively from their actual theoretical amounts, as the companies agreed not to dispute the objections stated against them, and also gave commitments regarding their future behaviour that were likely to restore proper price competition to the market for children's video cassettes. BVHE gave a commitment to overhaul its general conditions of sale to retailers and wholesalers, and agreed to restructure its discount system. Carrefour offered a commitment to alter the criteria according to which it accepts discounts from wholesaler-distributors with all the suppliers on the video cassette and DVD market. Both companies stated their intention to keep the Conseil de la concurrence's executive case officer informed about the actual implementation of the proposed commitments. See the decision (05-D-70)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Pharmaceutical laboratories do not abuse their dominant position when they restrict or refuse deliveries of medicines to exporters, who seek to purchase products in France at an administered price,in order to then sell them on in another country at a higher price. Following a referral by several exporting companies regarding practices implemented by 21 pharmaceutical laboratories*, the Conseil de la concurrence has handed down a non-suit decision, on the grounds that the behaviour concerned by the complaint could not be qualified as abuse of a dominant position under French and EC competition law. Parallel trade in medicines in Europe \"Parallel trade in pharmaceuticals\" is based on the existence of different prices for medicines between European countries. It refers to trading in medicines between wholesaler-exporters and importers in different countries, as opposed to the sale of pharmaceuticals in different countries by the laboratories themselves, either directly or via local subsidiaries. The products concerned by parallel trade are mainly patented compounds, for which there is a substantial difference (at least 15%) between the regulated price in force in the State from which the products are exported, and the price in force in the countries where they are consumed. The price level of French medicines is close to the European average. However, it is 20% lower than those practised in the United Kingdom and Germany, to the extent that France is an export base for both these markets. A number of French companies have based their business exclusively on exports, purchasing pharmaceuticals from laboratories in France at an \"administered\" price, and then selling them on abroad at a higher price. This is the case with Pharma-Lab, Pharmajet, Pharmadex TMC, European Trade Company (ETC) and AD Pharm, who originally brought the proceedings that are now before the Conseil de la concurrence. These companies complained that the pharmaceutical laboratories had subjected them to delivery restrictions, discriminatory conditions and refusal to sell products. The complainants ascribed these practices to two things: firstly, agreements, between the laboratories themselves, and between the laboratories and wholesaler-distributors; and secondly, an abuse of a dominant position by the laboratories. The Conseil de la concurrence ruled that the existence of a cartel between the laboratories or an agreement between the same laboratories and wholesaler-distributors could not be proven The Conseil de la concurrence did observe that there was a certain similarity in the behaviour of the major laboratories, which saw them gradually restrict their deliveries to exporters before eventually halting them altogether, whilst continuing to supply the national wholesaler-distributors (even where they delivered for export via their specialist subsidiaries). However, the Conseil also observed that the practices and the way they developed were not identical, either in terms of the methods employed or the calendar according to which they were implemented. It found that in any case, such similarity in behaviour would not alone suffice to prove the existence of any anticompetitive agreement, which must be supported by serious, accurate and corroborating evidence showing real collaboration. With regard to the allegation of discrimination between exporters and wholesaler-distributors, the Conseil de la concurrence took the view that this could not be proven either. Both categories of operator do business on the wholesale pharmaceuticals markets under different legal regimes, which may provide justification for them being treated differently: the wholesaler-distributors are bound by stringent public service obligation, which is not the case for exporters. The Conseil de la concurrence did not believe the laboratories were acting in an abusive way by restricting deliveries or refusing sales to exporters It is not an abuse for a laboratory to defend its commercial interests by refusing to deliver a product at an administered price, where that product is only sought by a pure exporter on the grounds that he can make a profit by reselling it on a foreign market, and where the product will certainly not be sold on the national market for which the administered price has been fixed. The Conseil's decision only covers the case of pure exporters – whose status differs from that of wholesaler-distributors, who are bound by public service obligations. It took the view that the supply restrictions concerned by the complaint constituted reasonable and proportionate measures which, given the limited activity of the exporters, were unlikely to prevent parallel trade. The Conseil stated its opposition to the complainant companies' suggestion that there should be \"quotas\" reserved for exporters, which it feels would create real competition problems.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence imposes fines totalling 26.1 million Euros on nearly 80 companies and professional organizations   Following a complaint filed by the Minister of Economy, the Conseil de la concurrence has handed down a decision which penalizes 70 companies specializing in the manufacture and sale of heating, ceramic sanitary and plumbing equipment, along with 7 professional federations of manufacturers, wholesalers and fitters, guilty of implementing anticompetitive practices between 1993 and 1998. The initial inquiry and the subsequent full investigation were extremely detailed and took some considerable time, due to the complex nature and exceptional size of the case file. Sixteen different objections were notified to 137 companies, and the various case documents amounted to some 37,000 pages. The Conseil uncovered a series of horizontal and vertical agreements, organized by the traditional players in the sector with the aim of evicting the major French “do-it-yourself” retailers (including Leroy-Merlin, Castorama, Monsieur Bricolage and Bricorama) from the market, along with the fitters' co-operatives, which began selling sanitary and heating products at low prices from 1992.  The fines imposed range from €400 up to €7,500,000. The extent of each company's role in the implementation of the various practices was assessed on a case-by-case basis. This explains the substantial differences in the fines imposed, which also take account of the companies' sales figure. Common eviction strategies designed to bar access to the market for major retailers and fitters' co-operatives Anticompetitive meetings At meetings held mostly under the aegis of their professional federation, the FNAS*, the trader-wholesalers agreed to block supplies to the major DIY retailers and fitters' co-operatives and to restrict these circuits' access to the up- and downstream markets. The methods agreed upon to achieve this aim included:  · launching boycotts and threatening to delist manufacturers, or suppliers who supplied the major DIY retailers and fitters' co-operatives, from lists of approved suppliers, · putting pressure on wholesaler-traders who were members of the federation, in an effort to prevent them from selling their products on to the major DIY retailers and fitters' co-operatives, · putting pressure on fitters, to prevent them from purchasing and installing equipment sold by the major DIY retailers, or from joining fitters' co-operatives. Use of supplier lists for anticompetitive purposes A number of listing groups (Centramat, GSP, GSE) and some of their trader-wholesaler members adopted an anticompetitive sales policy, by removing or threatening to remove manufacturers from their approved supplier lists, if they agreed to supply competing fitters' co-operatives and the major DIY retailers. Agreements between manufacturers and wholesalers  The Conseil showed that the FNAS and the members of the groups Centramat, GSP and GSE respectively consulted one another with manufacturers to curb the development or creation of competing fitters' co-operatives or major DIY retailers. For example, the Centramat group and its members made 23 manufacturers sign a charter, requiring each of them to refrain from supplying these competing circuits. Meanwhile, the FNAS, via its \"associate members\" charter, invited manufacturers to stop supplying the major DIY retailers and fitters' co-operatives or to offer them discriminatory sales conditions. In exchange, the FNAS offered to include the manufacturers in its approved supplier lists. Clause restricting competition in boiler distribution contracts The Conseil de la concurrence observed that the distribution contracts established by the companies Saunier Duval, De Dietrich, ELM Leblanc, Chaffoteaux & Maury and Frisquet (and which are still in force), have the aim and the effect of restricting the resale of heating products solely to professional fitters. This obligation goes beyond the legitimate safety requirements specific to these appliances.  It would have been sufficient simply to include a clause in which the supplier agrees to supply any distributor with boilers for retail, provided the distributor concerned agrees to ensure that the appliances are installed or replaced only by professional fitters, or that a certificate of conformity is systematically established whenever an appliance is fitted. The Conseil points out that, where the same objective can be achieved by means that are less restrictive of competition, that solution should be preferred. Consequently, the companies Saunier Duval, ELM Leblanc, Chaffoteaux et Maury, Frisquet and De Dietrich Thermique were ordered to amend their distribution contracts. Specifically, they were required to remove the clauses that had the aim or effect of restricting the resale of heating products solely to professional fitters. They were granted a period of four months, following notification of the decision, in which to comply with the Conseil's orders.   > Decision n° 06-D-03 of 9th March 2006 relative to practices implemented in the sector of heating, sanitary, plumbing and air-conditioning appliances > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (29th January 2008)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence imposes fines totalling 45.4 million Euros on 13 companies operating luxury perfume and cosmetic brands, and 3 national distribution chains  The Conseil de la concurrence , having begun proceedings ex off icio, has issued a decision in which it finds 13 companies operating luxury perfume and cosmetics brands guilty of entering into anticompetitive agreements with their distributors, concerning the retail price to consumers. The Conseil has also imposed fines on three national distribution chains, for the same offence. Each of the brands had entered into agreement with its distributors, to ensure that every product was retailed at a single fixed price, thereby eliminating any possibility of competition between different retail outlets. The fines imposed total 45.4 million Euros, and break down as follows: Suppliers Beauté Prestige International (Jean-Paul Gaultier and Issey Miyake): 810,000 Euros Chanel: 3 million Euros Parfums Christian Dior: 2.2 million Euros Comptoir nouveau de la parfumerie (Hermès): 410,000 Euros ELCO (Clinique and Estée Lauder): 1.6 million Euros Parfums Givenchy: 550,000 Euros Guerlain: 1.7 million Euros Kenzo Parfums: 600,000 Euros L'Oréal Produits de luxe France: 4.1 million Euros Pacific Création Parfums (Lolita Lempicka): 90,000 Euros Shiseido France: 340,000 Euros Thierry Mugler Parfums: 640,000 Euros       Distributors                   Setting up of vertical price agreements Between 1997 and 2000, the above companies operating luxury perfume and cosmetics brands entered into agreements with the distributors in their commercial networks, and in particular the national chains Marionnaud, Nocibé and Séphora. The purpose of the agreements was to put a stop to any competition between retailers, for each of the brands' products. Each supplier of perfumes or cosmetics set its distributors a \" recommended retail price \" for each of its products, and also indicated the maximum discount they were permitted to practise in order to level up the retail prices of the products concerned. Each agreement organised by the supplier also saw the introduction of a \" pricing control system \". This involved checks on the prices practised, and pressure and threats of commercial retaliation against any distributor who refused to apply the prices imposed by the brand, preferring to let competition play by selling at lower prices. An analysis of the price listings recorded during the course of the investigation revealed that the agreement was highly effective, as the prices applied largely adhered to the levels agreed between the companies. The need to defend the brand image cannot justify the restrictions placed on free price determination Under national and European case law, brands with a \" luxury \" image are permitted to exercise a certain degree of control over the situation of the retail outlets distributing their products. They are allowed to check that their products are displayed advantageously. This approach, which is known as selective distribution, leads the brand to choose its sales outlets very rigorously. However, the case law in question does not permit brands to prevent the selected distributor from fixing its own margins, and therefore its own retail prices. This distributor's freedom to determine its own margins and prices is beneficial to end consumers, who can take advantage of competition between retail outlets for the same brand products and obtain better prices. The accused brands unsuccessfully attempted to argue that by harmonizing retail prices at a high level, they were merely attempting to protect their products' \"luxury image\". In reality, the lack of competition resulting from the agreement between the producer and its distributors actually enables everyone to raise, and then share, the surplus obtained, at the consumer's expense. These practices contravene Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article L.420-1 of the French code of commercial law ( code de commerce ). The Conseil has already penalized \"recommended\" price practices that in fact amount to imposed prices, on a number of occasions ( 03-D-45 , school calculators / 05-D-07 , Winchester, arms and munitions sector / 05-D-66 , TVHA, consumer electronics sector / 05-D-70 , Disney children's videocassettes). It has also imposed penalties on companies for granting discounts on the condition that the price of the manufacturer is respected ( 05-D-32 , Royal Canin), and has punished clauses relating to advertising for luxury brands, where they are used to deter distributors from running advertising campaigns based on prices ( 96-D-72 , Rolex / 01-D-45 , Ray Ban). Serious practices and damage to the economy Since the practices concerned in this case have the aim and effect of preventing the free market from setting prices, they are deemed to constitute \"hardcore restrictions\" on competition, under the European Commission's Guidelines on Vertical Restraints, issued on 13 October 2000. Although not as exceptionally serious as horizontal agreements between competitors (cartels), they are nonetheless serious, since they have the effect of depriving consumers of the benefits they are entitled to expect from competition between different retailers selling the products of a same brand. Instead, the benefits remain with the parties responsible for the offending practices. In judging the extent of the damage caused to the economy, the Conseil took into account the duration of the practices (from 1997 to 2000) and the size of the market affected (814.5 million Euros for the brands penalized).  > Decision 06-D-04 of 13th March 2006 relative to practices observed in the luxury perfume sector > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (26th June 2007) and decision dated 27th July 2007 correcting > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 10th July 2008 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (10th November 2009) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeals) - 23rd November 2010 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (26th January 2012) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeals) - 11th June 2013 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (10th April 2014) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeals) - 9th June 2015",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la Concurrence requires Gîtes de France to remove or alter the exclusivity clauses imposed on its members   Following a referral by the Ministry of Economy, the Conseil de la Concurrence has handed down a decision imposing a penalty on Gîtes de France national federation for abusing its dominant position in the labelled self-catering and Bed & Breakfast market, and has asked the federation to alter a number of clauses in its membership contracts. Gîtes de France's domination over the labelled self-catering and Bed & Breakfast market Gîtes de France, Clévacances and Accueil Paysan are the main organizations offering labels to owners of self-catering accommodation in France. Within the labelled Bed & Breakfast market there are, in addition to the three labels already mentioned, two other names: Fleurs de Soleil and Bed&Breakfast (B&B). Gîtes de France has at least a 70% market share within these two markets and its position in the market for labelling is further strengthened by the favourable situation that it enjoys within department-level public organizations. In this respect, the Conseil de la Concurrence noted that there was some confusion in structures between Gîtes de France and a number of public bodies concerned with tourism (regional tourist boards, chambers of agriculture and local and regional government). Consequently, Gîtes de France had obtained a preponderant position in public procedures for determining and allocating subsidies. The practices involved: exclusivity clauses imposed on members by Gîtes de France  Members are bound by 3 types of exclusivity clauses laid down by Gîtes de France: A membership exclusivity clause for Gîtes de France label, which prohibits simultaneous membership of another label organization.   This clause means more than an owner simply not being able to use two different labels for the same accommodation, it also makes it impossible for him to market another nearby holiday rental facility (bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering accommodation or a camp site) which is not registered under the Gîtes de France label.    Publication exclusivity clause: under this clause, all advertising issued by members can only be done through guides published by Gîtes de France.    Exclusive marketing clause: when owners do not market their accommodation themselves, this exclusivity clause requires the marketing to be done by the booking service accredited by the “Relais départemental” of Gîtes de France organization when there is one in the region. Exclusivity clauses which hinders the development of competing labels The Conseil de la concurrence estimated that, given Gîtes de France's dominant position, these exclusivity clauses are abusive in so far as they tend to lock in customers and that they enable Gîtes de France to control the whole marketing chain for accommodation bearing its label – during all the membership period (which is 10 years when subsidies are involved). The Conseil took the view that these clauses hinder the development of competing labels and restrict members' commercial freedom and that their duration and scope were excessive. Injunctions The Conseil limited its fine to €10,000, but it made several injunctions ordering the Federation to:  · Remove the following from its contracts: - the clause requiring the prior approval of the local Gîtes de France organization for advertising in media other than those published by the Gîtes de France network; - the clause prohibiting owners from simultaneously managing furnished holiday accommodation - or other forms of holiday accomodation - owned by them, but not labelled Gîtes de France, nearby their Gîtes de France approved accommodation. · Restrict to the first two years of joining the Gîtes de France network, the clause forbidding members to use double labelling for the same rural self-catering accommodation (except in cases where the Federation has signed an agreement with a third party) . The same restriction is to be applied to the clause requiring members who do not want to advertise their accommodation themselves to advertise through the local Gîtes de France organization (even for a membership period exceeding two years or for a tacit or explicit membership renewal).  There shall be a 4-month deadline for complying with these injunctions. Non-compliance will incur a €150 penalty payment per day starting from the deadline expiry date. > Decision 06-D-06 of March 17th 2006 concerning the practices implemented in the sector of tourist accommodation, rural self-catering and Bed & Breakfast sector",

        "full_text_press_realease": "34 building and civil engineering companies have been fined a total of 48 million euros by the Conseil de la Concurrence for engaging in widespread anti-competitive agreements involving public procurement contracts in the Ile-de-France (Greater Paris) area > Version française  The Conseil de la Concurrence has imposed fines totalling 48 million euros on 34 companies for entering into prior agreements over the allocation of a large number of public calls for tender in the Ile-de-France (Greater Paris) area. The Conseil began proceedings ex officio following criminal prosecution of several individuals which started in 1994, but which was halted in November 2002 when the cases against the accused were dismissed. The Conseil de la Concurrence found that from the end of 1991 through to 1997, these major building and civil engineering companies (along with their subsidiaries) entered into bid-rigging agreements covering public procurement contracts in the Ile-de-France area, and that many other companies were brought into the process. The Conseil's findings were based on papers and documents passed on to it by the investigating magistrate; in particular the inquiry report carried out by the Director General of Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), which was based on letters rogatory. In all, these actions distorted the tendering processes for around forty contracts, among which the Eole and Meteor urban rail and metro projects for French State Railways (SNCF) and the Greater Paris transport authority (RATP). Bids for all major public procurement contracts for the Ile-de-France area were divided up by the companies through “pooling agreements”. Through this general agreement, the major companies divided up upcoming work projects between their subsidiaries during “pooling” meetings in which the companies' managers discussed their desired future public work projects. The documents seized during the inquiry identified ten such “pooling meetings”. At these meetings, bids were shared out on a geographical basis (the five départments 78, 92, 93, 94 and 95), by project type (Eole and Meteor), by contracting authority (SNCF, RATP, the City of Paris and organizations involved in highway and water and waste services such as the Syndicat Interdépartemental pour l'Assainissement de l'Agglomération Parisienne and the Direction Départementale de l'Equipement) and by the type of work involved (such as surface concrete). The market sharing arrangements operated over a long period and were based on a particularly sophisticated allocation system. It gave rise to regular meetings between the companies, which were designed to organise the sharing out of tender bids and to ensure compliance with the prospective allocations. It was implemented through regular exchanges of information and by a process involving cover bids. Adherence to the formula devised for sharing out the bids was achieved through accounting operations concerning loans and payments in arrears for each company and by a system of compensatory measures which involved cash payments, awarding official or covert sub-contracts as well as by setting up undeclared partnerships. Very serious practices... Through setting up such agreements, the building and civil engineering companies concerned knowingly broke competition rules. The bidding process meant that the contracting authorities were misled through not being able to gain from bids which would have enabled them to award contracts on a best price basis. The Conseil made the point that the widespread nature of these agreements caused particularly serious economic damage because it affected a fast-expanding sector covering a large geographical area. It also found that the amounts were high (around 1 billion euros) for the contracts affected by these agreements. ... requiring fines that should be exemplary in nature Taking these factors into account, the Conseil has imposed fines of 5% of their turnover on the major companies of the sector. This is the maximum allowed by the legislation that was in force at the time (1) . For the remaining companies, the fines range from 1% to 4% of their turnover. The largest fines are set out as follows: Bouygues and its current subsidiaries:   - Bouygues 3,400,000 euros   - Colas IDFN 4,000,000 euros   - Screg IDF Normandie 1,800,000 euros   - Sacer Paris Nord-Est 1,300,000 euros    Eiffage and its current subsidiaries: - Eiffage 1,050,000 euros - Eiffage Construction 1,000,000 euros - Eiffage TP 4,300,000 euros - Effiparc IDF 27,000 euros Vinci and its current subsidiaries: - Vinci 1,213,000 euros - Vinci Construction 127,000 euros  - Chantiers Modernes 30,000 euros  - Parenge 300,000 euros - TPI 760,000 euros Soletanche Bachy 5,600,000 euros Sade CGTH 5,400,000 euros Guintoli 4,000,000 euros Razel 4,000,000 euros Bec Frères 2,400,000 euros Demathieu et Bard 2,000,000 euros Spie Batignolle TPCI 1,600,000 euros Urbaine de Travaux 1,200,000 euros Nord France Eau et Environnement 137,000 euros Botte Fondations 600,000 euros Sefi Intrafor 560,000 euros Valentin 470,000 euros The companies named have been fined either because they were themselves involved in these malpractices or because they have become successors in interest to the companies concerned (1) The measures contained in article L.464-2 of the Code of Commercial Law (Code de Commerce) have since been altered by the New Economic Regulations Law (known as the loi NRE).

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence implements the leniency procedure for the first time and fines two national cartels  The Conseil de la concurrence has handed down a decision penalizing nine companies in the sector of wooden door manufacturing for engaging in price agreements. The fines amount to 5 million euros pursuant to national and European Competition Law. In the first application of its new leniency program - details are available on the website www.conseil-concurrence.fr - the Conseil has exempted from financial penalties the France Portes company, which sought to take advantage of the procedure. Given its role in the cartel, France Portes incurred a 1.25 million euro fine. It benefited from total immunity in compensation for the fact that the company: was the first to provide convincing evidence, contributing to establish the existence of two cartels (one cartel on flush doors and another cartel on lacquered doors) and to identify the authors;    showed complete co-operation with Competition authorities throughout the procedure;    did not exert pressure on the other members of the cartel;     ended its involvement in the cartel practices from the opening of the procedure and did not warn the other members of the denounced cartels. The existence of a leniency procedure introduces permanent insecurity among cartels “Leniency” is a new procedure open to companies , which may, in compensation for the denunciation of a cartel -which is unknown to the Competition authorities- in which they participated, be granted immunity at the end of the contentious procedure. This new instrument adds up to the Conseil de la concurrence's legal arsenal (injunctions, penalties, negotiated settlement procedure, commitments) and represents a powerful lever for the Conseil de la concurrence. The procedure enables to improve noticeably cartel detection, in particular horizontal cartels, which are the most serious practices, by introducing strong instability factor among cartels: members can at all time decide to withdraw from the cartel in order to benefit from immunity. Since its implementation, the French leniency program has met a certain success: the Conseil has recorded 17 requests which are under consideration. 80% of the requests have been filed since 1 May 2004, when the European Network for Competition (ECN) authorities was set up. Procedure stages In the present case, France Portes asked for the application of a leniency measure, by denouncing a cartel existing in the sector of wooden doors in France, in May 2002. In support of its denunciation, the company showed numerous pieces of evidence and produced a memorandum describing the major aspects concerning the history and the operating of the cartel. Afterwards the company denounced another cartel involved in lacquered doors. The Conseil de la concurrence granted France Portes the conditional benefit of leniency in an opinion issued on 23rdJuly 2002 and began proceedings ex officio. As part of this contentious procedure, the Conseil de la concurrence then immediately asked the DGCCRF to conduct an investigation which led to searches in the following days. The two cartels revealed The elements brought by France Portes, along with those seized during the investigation, enabled to establish the existence of two national cartels aimed at stabilizing prices by drafting common minimum price grids in a context of difficult market conditions for all the companies of the sector. The first cartel called “C5” or “the famous five”, active until the end of 2001, concerned the market for wooden flush doors. The cartel consisted of the following companies: France Portes, Ekem, Magri, Fonmarty, JH Industries, Righini, Malerba and Blocfer. These competing companies were in the habit of getting together after the meetings organized by the National Union of industrial carpentry manufacturers (SNFMI) in Bordeaux. The second cartel, active until 2000, concerned the market for lacquered doors. It consisted of the main producers of lacquered doors, namely Frances Portes, Berkvens-Svedex and Polydex. The meetings took place about once a year in Paris. Serious practices and the fines pronounced Cartels are considered by competition authorities as the most serious forms of practices, the OECD refers to them as hard-core cartels. In this particular case, the fixing of common minimum sale prices was aimed at restricting competition by prices between companies which should have been competing. Price fixing also had the effect of sharing the French market by preventing foreign operators to have access to the markets concerned. However the Conseil took into account - in determining the amount of the fines- of the fact that the minimum prices had not always been applied by the members of the two cartels, thus limiting the damage caused by cartels to the economy. The Conseil de la concurrence decided to impose on the following companies: Righini: a 430, 000 euro fine Malerba: a 1.4 million euro fine JH Industries: a 1.6 million euro fine Ekem: a 300, 000 euro fine Fonmarty: a 700,000 euro fine Magri: a 250,000 euro fine Blocfer: a 300, 000 euro fine Berkvens-Svedex: a 40,000 euro fine Polynorm, successor of Polydex: a 15,000 euro fine > Decision 06-D-09 of 11 April 2006, relative to practices implemented in the sector of door manufacturing > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (24th April 2007)",

        "full_text_press_realease": " Conseil de la concurrence orders association managing nurseries ( Bouches-du-Rhône département) to suspend application of amendment to employees' work contract  to ensure good development of next solicitation for public bidding Following a referral on February 22th by Bouc Bel Air town (Bouches-du-Rhône département) relative to practices implemented by the Bouc'choux association, managing three infancy facilities of the town, the Conseil de la concurrence ordered the association to suspend, for emergency reasons, the application of an amendment to the work contracts of 33 of its employees. In the current state of the procedure, the Conseil estimated that the amendment had the object and the effect to deter Bouc'Choux competitors from entering the market for the management of the town nurseries. An amendment to the work contract of Bouc'Choux employees could hinder competition on the market for the management of nurseries in the town of Bouc Bel Air The new French Code of procurement contracts (Code des marches publics) and European legislation hold that the management of infancy services are subject to solicitation for bids. Businesses subject to a procurement contract procedure are subject to the application of Article 122-12 of the Code of labour law (Code du travail), which holds that the employer coming in takes back all the work contracts of the previous employer. In this context the Bouc'Choux association adopted in June 2005, an amendment to the work contracts of 33 of its employees, offering each of them a lump sum of 100,000 euros, as soon as the number of employees exceeds 60 persons. The association is not concerned by this amendment since it limits its staff to approximately 40 employees, however most of its competitors could be concerned by the amendment. The Conseil has observed that the mechanism introduced by the amendment makes the payment of the 100,000 euro bonus to be borne not by the current employer, who signed the amendment, i.e. the association itself, but by the successor in case of successful bidding. According to Article 122-12 of the Code of Labour Law, the successor should take back all the employees. This provision would force the new employer, holder of the contract, to pay 3.3 million euros in total to the employees who signed the amendment, which deters competing companies from submitting their applications for the management of nurseries. The interim measure ordered by the Conseil aims at avoiding that a new distortion of competition arises during the next solicitation for public bidding The Conseil noted that the effects of the amendment on the procedure of public bidding were obvious during the solicitation for bids in Summer 2005. Keeping the amendment would therefore substantially hinder effective and fair competition during the next solicitation for bids which will be launched by Bouc Bel Air town in Summer 2006 for the management of nurseries from 2007. The Conseil has observed that numerous potential competitors of the Bouc'Choux association could exceed the 60 employee threshold after integration of the employees of the association. As part of an interim measure, the Conseil therefore ordered Bouc'Choux, to suspend the application of the amendment until the decision is taken on the merits of the case or until the amendment is effectively and legally removed, and to inform each employee. Within one month, the association will also have to present the situation of its employees' work contracts to the Conseil.

Small retailers coordinated their business policy and agreed on minimum retail prices in order to hinder the development of competing retailers, notably discount dealers - The Conseil penalized a series of horizontal agreements on prices between specialised retailers Gathered in networks such as Master Cycle (now MC2R) or Bouticycles, the Conseil observed that several retailers had set up anticompetitive meetings with the aim to restrict cycle distribution to traditional networks.  The Conseil considered that setting minimum resale “recommended” prices and predefined margin rates constituted serious practices, all the more that members of Master Cycle and Bouticyles intervened in their respective network to ensure that the “recommended” prices were respected and exerted pressure on their suppliers so that they stop delivering competing retailers who implement discount prices.  - The Conseil also penalized vertical agreements between specialized retailers and suppliers The Conseil also penalized certain suppliers for having coordinated their business policy with the retailers. The Conseil penalized the existence of anticompetitive clauses in the terms of sale and distribution contracts of several suppliers The Conseil also penalized: - a clause prohibiting retrocession between retailers on top-of-the-range equipment, which had the effect of preventing discount dealers to be supplied by other European suppliers.  - clauses subordinating the listing of suppliers of Master Cycle network to respect “recommended” prices  - clauses imposing minimum retail price on distributors - clause prohibiting exports Given the size of economic operators concerned by the practices, the Conseil considered that intra-Community trade had not been affected.  Lastly, the Conseil took into account the damage to the economy and the importance of inter-rand competition on the market since the practices concerned only intra-brand competition. > Decision 06-D-37 of December 2006 relative to practices implemented in the sector of cycle and cycle products  distribution  > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (4th March 2008)",

The Conseil has therefore closed the litigation proceedings. History of the case  At the end of 2003, the Conseil de la concurrence received a complaint, by the company Canal 9, which notably operates local radio Chante France as part of the group. Canal 9 complained that the GIE Les Indépendants (1)refused access to radio Chante France into the group. The company considered that this refusal was discriminatory and prevented Chante France from having access to the market for national advertisement, which is a necessary source of income for its financial balance. The GIE considered on the other hand that Chante France did not meet the statutory conditions required to join the group, notably because it belonged to a group of radio stations, which operates Skyrock station, classified in the national category (D category). The competition concerns During the investigation, the case officer transmitted to the group Les Indépendants a preliminary examination of the case in which were expressed competition concerns on the statutory conditions for the membership to the GIE, and on the way the statutes were implemented in practice. Indeed, it appeared that the membership conditions required to stay, or leave the GIE were neither objective nor transparent and were lacking a clear definition. Moreover, elements of the file led to believe that these inaccuracies could be used by the GIE to discriminate against certain radios. Lastly, the existence of severe penalties in case a radio left the group, also raised difficulties, in so far as this could lead to market foreclosure.  The case officer considered that there was no alternative solution economically equivalent to the membership of the GIE for an independent local radio anxious to enter the market for national advertisement. It was also considered that it could not be excluded that the agreement between the companies of the group, aimed at fixing the conditions for the membership and the keeping in the GIE, enters the area of application of the provisions of the code of commercial law, prohibiting agreements and abuse of dominant position, provided the conditions have the object or the effect to prevent, in discriminatory conditions, the access of certain local radios to the market for national advertisement. The commitments made by the GIE les Indépendants While challenging the anticompetitive character of the practices denounced by the plaintiff, the GIE Les Indépendants presented commitments to the Conseil de la concurrence. These proposals were published on the Conseil's website on June 15th 2006 in order to receive observations from potentially interested third parties. The examination of the commitments led to several amendments in their drafting.  The GIE Les indépendants has committed itself to reform its statutes as well as all the documents sent to applying radio stations in order to: clarify the conditions of eligibility, i.e. conditions which give an applying radio the possibility to receive an application file and to submit it to the GIE's Board of directors and General Assembly     specify membership conditions and notably their content (clarify the notion of « independence » towards national networks)    improve the clarity of the admission procedure, notably in formalizing the stages (receipt of the file, examination and effective admission) and defining precise deadlines.    review its exclusion procedure, in fixing deadlines    suppress the penalties required in case of a withdrawal from the group The impact of the commitments The Conseil has accepted the commitments, considering that they meet its own competition concerns, despite the fact that they do not entirely satisfy the plaintiff Canal 9. The Conseil points out, in this respect, that a decision to accept commitments cannot be used to satisfy the request of one party nor to reply to a particular interest, but rather to guarantee the good functioning of competition on a market with a public and economic objective.  (1) Interest economic group aimed at marketing advertising space of local or regional radio stations to national or international advertisers. Given the limited nature of their geographical coverage, local radio stations are attractive for national advertisers only when they are part of a group.  > Decision of October 6th 2006 relative to practices implemented by the GIE Les indépendants in the sector of radio advertisement    > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th November 2007) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of appeals) - 4th November 2008 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th October 2009) > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (1st June 2010)",

There is no cement manufacturer in Corsica and any cement, which is distributed has to be transported by sea. Most of the cement used is produced in the areas of Marseilles and Nice. The Conseil penalized two agreements which organised the exclusive supply of the Island with cements from Lafarge and Vicat and prevented competitors, notably Greeks and Italians to expand on the market The Conseil considered that Lafarge, Vicat and the Union of distributors-wholesalers had concluded a draft agreement  holding that Union members would stock up cement from Lafarge and Vicat for most of their needs and this for a minimum of four years. The agreement, which was tacitly renewed, artificially restricted competition on the market for the supply of cement and closed the access to these markets for Greek and Italian competitors, whose prices were on average 20% lower.  Besides, the Conseil considered that the signing of an agreement  , in which two cement manufacturers granted an economic interest group gathering the distributors-wholesalers from the region of Haute-Corse for a 30 year period, the exclusive exploitation of storage and packing infrastructures for cement of Bastia harbour. Indeed the agreement protected the economic interest group members from competition and reserved for Lafarge and Vicat the exclusive supply of cement, leading to a significant increase in prices in the region of Haute-Corse. The Conseil also penalized a practice of reduction rewarding wholesalers who did not purchase imported cement as well as a special agreement between two wholesalers The Conseil considered that some reductions, granted by Lafarge and Vicat to members of the Union and the economic interest group during certain periods between 1997 and 1999, were anticompetitive since they were granted under the sole condition that the benefiting wholesaler had not imported in Corsica other cement than the one produced by Lafarge and Vicat. Lastly, two wholesalers of Ajaccio have been condemned for having coordinated their prices. The Conseil imposed penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the behaviours concerned and the importance of the damage caused to the economy of Corsica. The Conseil imposed on: · Lafarge company, a €17 million fine ; · Company Vicat, a € 8 million fine ; · The economic interest group, a €15, 000 euro fine ; · The Union of wholesalers for building material, a €15, 000 euro fine ; · Simat Simongiovani company, a €70, 000 euro fine ; · Gedimat Anchetti company, a €150, 000 euro fine.

In France, this is the first case to penalize predatory prices. A predatory price is an unusually low price, i.e. below the variable costs of the company. The predation mechanism works as follows: First the company offers very low prices so as to evict or discourage the arrival of competition on a given market. Once competition has been eliminated, the company can raise its prices to the detriment of the consumer and regain the losses made during the first phase. In 1999 and 2000 Glaxo laboratory sold injectable Zinnat® at a price below costs so as to deter generic drug manufacturers from effectively entering the hospital market  Glaxo laboratory sales Zinnat® , an antibiotic, which is commonly used in hospitals before operations. The Conseil de la concurrence considered that the prices proposed by Glaxo for this drug had a predatory nature on 43 hospital markets concluded in 1999 and 2000. The sale prices of injectable Zinnat® were lower than the price paid for the drug by Glaxo France, which provided itself at another group's subsidiary.  Once Flavelab was out of the market, Glaxo laboratory noticeably raised its prices in a profitable way during the following two years, thus largely regaining the losses recorded during the predation period. The predation policy was part of a global intimidation strategy aimed at discouraging generic drug manufacturers from entering the hospital medicine market The predation policy, which focused on a relatively small sized market (market for cefuroxime sodium was about 1 million euros), actually had a more general objective for Glaxo, which consisted in making an aggressive reputation and sending a “signal” aimed at deterring small sized generic manufacturers from entering the market of hospital medicines.  The strategy produced an unexpected impact since it led to evict Flavelab laboratory from the hospital market. The strategy also deterred Panpharma and Ggam laboratories - other players on the market of cefuroxime sodium- from developing other Glaxo generic drugs, such as acyclovir, an antiviral injection sold to hospitals under the brand name Zovirax®, the laboratory's leading product. These practices hindered the development of generic drugs in hospitals and thus seriously damaged the sector's economy The development of generic drugs, which are cheaper than brand name drugs, is essential for favouring a reduction in average drug price, a major item in hospital budget. Such practices thus damaged the sector's economy in a difficult context of health expenditure control.  Besides, the Conseil reminded that eviction practices were very serious practices by nature and that they had been implemented by a laboratory which was, at the time, the first supplier of pharmaceutical medicines for hospitals.   > Decision 07-D-09 of 24 February 2007, relative to practices implemented by GlaxoSmithKline France laboratory > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (8th April 2008) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeals) 17th March 2009",

In the present case, the Conseil decided that this table was anticompetitive as it encouraged price alignment and restricted competition among collecting organisations.  The Conseil condemned the FNA to 13, 500 euros, the FFCAT to 31, 600 euros and the AGPM to 36, 000 euros.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence penalizes 12 companies member of public buildings and works sector groups to 47.3 million euros for general agreement  In a ruling dated 27 February 2007, the Paris Court of appeal confirmed the criminal penalties handed down on October 26th 2006 by the Paris county court against leaders of the companies Bouygues Bâtiment, CBC Ile-de-France, Dumez Ile-de-France, Fougerolle, GTM, Nord France, SAEP, SCGPM and SPIE. The leaders were sentenced on the basis of Article L.420-1 of the code de commerce for having “fraudulently taken (…) a personal and decisive role in the elaboration, the orgranisation and the implementation of an agreement having the object or likely to have the effect to prevent, to restrict or to distort competition on the market”. On the basis of corroborating statements collected during the criminal proceedings, the Conseil de la concurrence, which submitted a referral ex-officio but which had also received several complaints from the Ile-de-France regional council (Conseil régional), has penalized the companies, which have taken part in the agreement. Between 1989 and 1996, 14 companies, some of which are the result of a restructuring of several companies and belong to six groups from the public buildings and works sector active in France during the period concerned participated in a general and continuous agreement with the aim to share 88 public markets for a total of 10 billion French francs. A case with an exceptional complexity and scope  In 1990, the Conseil régional d'Ile-de-France launched a broad programme to renovate school public buildings. The poor state of the buildings led the local authorities to allocate 241 public works markets for a total cost of 23.3 billion French francs, i.e. the highest amount ever involved by public authorities for this type of operation. The 88 markets concerned were part of the deal. The high number of the markets concerned and the existence of criminal proceedings led to a particularly long and complex investigation. The companies divided up the markets among them during meetings before the takeover bids  . Information exchanges and market sharing  The corroborating statements of the company leaders concerned showed that from 1989, even before the launch of the first set of markets, the companies gathered together and agreed on the principle of sharing all the future markets. They confirmed that the seven sets of public markets launched by the Ile-de-France region led to other meetings to share the markets, direct contacts between companies and information exchanges.  The participants to the general agreement belonged to the groups, which attended the meetings and launched the principle. . The agreement operated during 7 years under the aegis of Patrimoine Ingénierie, assistant of the contracting authority The operating mode was always the same and allowed the agreement to operate over the long term. First, the companies were pre-selected by a hidden committee in which Patrimoine Ingénierie had notably the role to enforce the rule of market sharing between SMEs and company groups (1/3; 2/3), which was supported by Ile-de-France regional council.  Second, according to the agreed sharing plan, each pre-selected company managed either to obtain the allocation of the market through unveiling to its “competitors” the markets it had selected and communicating its prices, or to renounce the allocation in offering a deliberately overestimated price (cover bid). The good operating of the general sharing of markets was ensured by Patrimoine Ingénierie, which gave information beforehand to the companies on future operations, and afterwards ensured that the pre-selected company obtained the market. The Conseil stressed that the general agreement caused a particularly serious damage to the economy… The Conseil stressed the extreme seriousness of the companies' behaviour. In implementing such practices, some of the most important public buildings and works companies deliberately infringed competition rules and managed to make unduly margins, which are much higher than the ones usually observed in the sector.  The Conseil underlined the fact that the general agreement caused a particularly serious damage to the economy, as a result of the signal sent by the major companies to other companies of the sector. … which justifies exemplary penalties Given these elements, the Conseil de la concurrence imposed on the companies of the sector penalties which account for 5% of their turnover – i.e. the maximum amount authorized by the legislation applicable at the time, except for two companies for lack of turnover at the time of budget balance. The Conseil therefore imposed on the companies the following penalties :  · Bouygues SA : 3, 213, 000 euros ; · Bouygues Bâtiment Ile-de-France SA : 20, 765, 000 euros ; · Gespace France SA : 242, 100 euros ; · Entreprise de Travaux Publics André et Max Brezillon : 13, 338, 000 euros ; · Compagnie Générale de Bâtiment et de construction (CBC) SA : 9, 200 euros ; · Société Industrielle de Constructions Rapides (Sicra) SNC : 516, 300 euros ; · Fougerolle SAS : 7, 600 euros ; · Spie-SCGPM : 7, 341, 000 euros ; · Vinci Construction : 270, 200 euros ; · Eiffage Construction : 527, 500 euros ; · Spie SA, formerly Amec SA : 1, 078, 000 euros ; · Nord France Boutonnat SARL : 6, 300 euros. .

On 3 April 2002, the Conseil de la concurrence received a complaint by the pharmaceutical distribution union (Chambre syndicale de la répartition pharmaceutique, CSRP) and on 20 October 2003, a complaint by the company Phoenix Pharma, concerning practices implemented by several pharmaceutical laboratories, which had set up quota systems for supplying medicines to wholesale distributors in France. Phoenix Pharma's referral was accompanied by a request for interim measures, which had been rejected by the Conseil de la concurrence in its decision n° 04-D-05. However some part of the referral had been retained concerning quota practices of four laboratories. The two referrals on the merits have been joined and the investigation enabled to examine the quota operating systems of six laboratories, which had set up delivery quotas on the French market. With regard to this context the companies Boehringer Ingelheim France, Laboratoires Merck-Sharp & Dohme-Chibret, Lilly France and Sanofi-Aventis proposed commitments. Competition concerns Medicine distribution in France is organised so as to meet general interest issues, which are set by the public health code. Mainly provided by wholesale distributors, medicine distribution to pharmacies is subject to delivery quotas by laboratories. The quotas are determined by criteria, which are exclusive to each laboratory and notably take into account the record of sales to pharmacies by every wholesaler. But these systems were characterized by little transparency, a relative rigidity to face wholesalers' business fluctuations and were not favourable to new entrants. If these quota systems have the legitimate aim to rationalize production and optimize medicine distribution with regard to each country's need, the restrictions imposed by this regulation have to be limited to what is strictly necessary for a reliable and optimal supply of the French market, whilst maintaining real competition possibilities between wholesale distributors. The pharmaceutical laboratories' commitment proposals So as to meet the competition concerns expressed by the Conseil de la concurrence, the companies Boehringer Ingelheim France, Laboratoires Merck-Sharp & Dohme-Chibret, Lilly France et Sanofi-Aventis proposed commitments, which have been completed at the Conseil's request, amending the supply system of medicines so as to increase its fluidity, flexibility and transparency. From now on, the quotas imposed on wholesale distributors may be adjusted according to their business activity since deliveries may exceed the quotas initially fixed. It also includes to improve information to wholesale distributors concerning system operating conditions. New entrants on the market will be granted distribution quotas so as to be able to start their business activity in satisfactory conditions. The Conseil has accepted these commitments and closed the proceedings. The flexibility introduced by the supply system of wholesalers enables to maintain competition through services between wholesalers. The introduction of accurate information relative to the system conditions meets, for its part, the transparency requirement. > Decision 07-D-22, relative to practices implemented in the sector of medicine distribution  > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (26th November 2008) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of appeals) - 2nd February 2010",

The Havre port authority abusively used its dominant position in applying to Sogema a price twice superior to the one applied to the CIPHA The Conseil has established that the port authority, a public institution managing harbour infrastructures, had applied different prices to the use of its public unloading equipment in the MTV terminal, depending on whether the dock work was managed by the CIPHA, terminal concessionary for the storage and by its subcontractors such as the SHGT or on the contrary by its competitors such as Sogema. Such a discrimination, based on the status of the company and not on the effective use of equipment, cannot be justified by the objective to make the storage infrastructures managed by CIPHA more attractive, fact which does not depend on the company chosen. These practices are serious since they are implemented by a public operator in charge of a public service mission, the infrastructures of which are essential to enable companies to unload ships. The CIPHA abused its dominant position in selling its customers tied offers combining storage and dock work The CIPHA, which holds a dominant position on the coal storage market on the Seine low valley, used its position to distort competition on the related market for dock work. The de facto tied offers - combining storage and dock work services- offered by the company, had the effect to evict Sogema from the dock work market, since the company had to pay twice the price paid by the CIPHA and its subcontractors. The CIPHA and the SHGT agreed to prevent Sogema to enter the dock work market These two companies agreed on anticompetitive clauses, which were included in several draft contracts between the CIPHA and Capcol, for the unloading of coal intended for electric power stations on the MTV terminal. The agreement, the aim of which was to lead Sogema to renounce its request to extend its own storage infrastructures in exchange for its temporary participation in the handling of EDF coal unloaded in the terminal, led to evict Sogema from the market. The latter had refused the clause which concerned it and therefore could only offer Capcol competitive dock work prices. Capcol then chose the CIPHA and its subcontractor SHGT to unload coal from the MV/Manna ship in November 2000 and thus avoid to pay the dock work on a public price basis, much superior to the price negotiated and applied to the CIPHA for the use of the equipment. The penalties  The Conseil considered that the practices were serious and had created a real damage to the economy. The penalties break down as follows :  · Havre Port authority : €2, 600, 000 ; · CIPHA : €150, 000 ; · SHGT : €55, 000. The penalties are accompanied by a publication injunction in an issue of « Paris-Normandie » and in the newspaper « L'Antenne ». > Decision 07-D-28 of 13 September 2007, relative to practices implemented by the Havre port authority, the CIPHA and the SHGT > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (5th November 2008)",

The commitments concern wholesale electricity supplies for retail sale by EDF's competitors on the free market. The margin squeeze denounced by Direct Energie In December 2005, Direct Energie signed a five year electricity supply contract with EDF with price conditions such that the company was unable to market viable commercial products to small professionals at levels competitive with the incumbent's “EDF Pro” price range.  Noting that this situation could create a margin squeeze effect and therefore constitute an abuse of dominant position on the part of EDF, the Conseil de la concurrence ordered interim measures in its Decision of 28 June 2007, ordering EDF to market base-load electricity in order to allow alternative suppliers to effectively compete with the incumbent operator's retail sales on the free market. The Conseil had however given EDF the opportunity to respond to this order by offering commitments within a short deadline. EDF offered commitments on 13 July 2007. These commitments were subject to a market test, which allowed the Conseil to collect observations from 21 companies and organisations.  The Conseil also consulted the CRE (Commission for Energy Regulation). The Conseil took into account the regulator's opinion and the market test's results to significantly improve and clarify EDF's initial proposal. EDF's wholesale offer: a significant improvement of supply conditions for electricity suppliers on the free market EDF offers alternative suppliers a five year contract with a ten year extension option for an annual volume of 10.5 TWh representing a total power of 1500 MW. This power will be made available in three calls for tender at different time periods, expected in 2008-2009 so as to give new entrants access to the new wholesale product.  The quantity of electricity thus offered exceeds the free market's current consumption and would allow alternative suppliers to multiply by four their electricity sales volumes on the retail market. Access to this offer will be made via a bidding system for the ten-years option price. The total 15 year contract would guarantee alternative operators long-term foresight regarding the conditions of their supply in base-load electricity. This foresight is currently lacking from products available on the wholesale market.  Moreover EDF committed to ensure that the price charged for supplies over the whole contract duration would not generate any margin squeeze with its own offers on the retail market. In this respect, the supply price is set at €36.8/MWh for the first year and will evolve according to market conditions.  This wholesale product will allow alternative suppliers to develop retail offers in conditions that will enable them to compete with those of EDF on the free market for small professionals and residential customers and to sell electricity at retail without incurring losses. > Decision 07-D-43 of 10 December 2007, relative to practices implemented in by EDF",

The second case of application of the French leniency programme In this second application of the leniency programme, the Conseil de la concurrence has granted total immunity to the companies Allied Arthur Pierre and Maison Huet SA (now Sirva SAS), which had denounced the existence of the cartel. These companies provided the Conseil with sufficient elements of proof, which enabled the Conseil to start proceedings ex officio concerning the denounced practices and launch an inquiry with visits and seizures in the sector concerned. The companies met with the aim to agree on the level of insurance rates and on the price of storehouses' rents In 2003 the major companies' representatives of the international removal sector in France (AGS Paris, Allied Arthur Pierre SA, Crown Worldwide, Interdean SAS, Raoult Grospiron International, Sterling International Movers SA and Transeuro Desbordes Worldwide Relocation) participated in informal meetings (‘Le Club') with the aim to exchange information on prices and costs and to determine jointly the minimum prices of insurance rate and storehouses' rent. Several companies belonging to ‘Le Cub' raised their storehouses' rents and insurance rates, thus aligning with other ‘Club' members' higher prices to the detriment of the consumer. The Conseil restated that practices consisting in fixing common prices constitute very serious practices, all the more that they were implemented by companies, which represented more than 50% of the international removal market in France. Some of these companies with other smaller companies also made accommodating estimates for the removal of military personnel The removal of military personnel is governed by specific regulation provisions, which force them to present their administration two or three competing estimates. In concrete terms, the military member contacts the remover, pays the agreed price but does not bear the removal cost in the end. The inquiry has showed that the companies concerned were sharing the market. To that end, the Maison Huet company had even designed a specific software to produce accommodating estimates so as to cheat on the paying company. The Conseil estimated that these practices were particularly serious, since they had the object and the effect to generate an artificial sharing out of the market between companies and to prevent the free price fixing by competition. As part of military removals, price gaps between 30 to 125% were registered between Maison Huet and its competitors when those established their estimate independently. Twelve companies were condemned to pay over €2 million The Conseil imposed proportioned sanctions taking into account the seriousness of the practices, the extent of the damage to the economy, the companies' individual situation and the fact that five companies have not contested the facts. The Conseil imposed the following on the companies: - AGS Paris, €975000 ; - Crown Worldwide, €180,000 ; - Interdean SAS, €288,000 ; - Raoult Grospiron International, €234,000;  - Sterling International Movers SA, €90,000 ; - Transeuro Desbordes Worldwide Relocation, €210,000 ; - Le Déménageur Européen, €4,500 ; - A.

The fines are as follows : · Biotronik France : €200 000 ; · Guidant France : €400 000 ; · ELA Medical France : €500 000 ; · Medtronic France : €1.1 million; · Saint Jude Medical France : €450, 000. The five defibrillator suppliers consulted each other in order to boycott a nation-wide call for tender  In May 2001, the Montpellier hospital was appointed by the 16 other hospitals to launch a joint call for tender for the purchase of implantable defibrillators. This new purchase procedure was expected to lower prices charged to hospitals and improve services provided. No tender having been submitted on the deadline, the call for tender was declared unsuccessful. Following a referral by the Ministry of economy, the investigation showed that the five suppliers met several times to discuss the behaviour they should adopt regarding this nation-wide call for tender and reached a joint decision to refuse to answer to the call for tender. During these meetings, the manufacturers also agreed on the legal and technical arguments used to attempt to make their common behaviour appear as parallel behaviours adopted separately by each of them. Horizontal agreements in the context of public procurement are harmful by their very nature Horizontal agreements in the context of public procurement are harmful by their very nature, regardless of the importance of the affected market and the infringements' duration, because they have as their object to directly impede the competitive process. In the case at hand, the infringement led to the failure of the first nation-wide call for tender for a grouped purchase of medical equipment. This failure impeded hospitals' ability to derive the benefits expected from a new type of call for tender, that is the rationalization of their purchasing practices and lower prices. It also led the relevant hospitals to forgo other similar tender procedures. > Decision 07-D-49 of 19 December 2007, relative to practices implemented by Biotronik, Ela Medical, Guidant, Medtronic and Saint Jude Medical in hospital supply in implantable defibrillators > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (8th April 2009)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence imposes a €37 million fine on 5 toy manufacturers and 3 distributors  Following a referral by the ministry of Economy, the Conseil de la concurrence issues a decision against five toy manufacturers for agreeing with distributors to fix Christmas toys' resale prices, to the detriment of consumers. The Conseil also imposed a fine on three distributors on the same grounds.  Total fines amount to €37 million and are broken down as follows : Suppliers : · Chicco – Puériculture de France : €600,000 · Goliath: €25,000 · Hasbro : €5.1million · Lego : €1.6 million · MegaBrands :€240,000 Distributors: · Carrefour: €27.4 million · MaxiToys :€1.8 million · EPSE (JouéClub) : €300,000  The Conseil considered that it had insufficient evidence - notably as regards pricing policies –to prove the involvement of other companies in the agreement under investigation and to which charges had been notified. Most of these other companies had not been subject to visits and seizures during the investigation led by the DGCCRF (Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control), prior to the ministerial referral. The suppliers concerned reached agreements with their distributors in order to fix their products' resale prices in all the retail outlets. Suppliers also monitored the market and retail pricing policies, practices in which the distributors concerned actively participated From 2001 to 2003 , during Christmas time, the suppliers concerned agreed respectively with their distributors in order to impede competition between retail outlets and to fix a single retail price for each of their products. These vertical agreements were accompanied by ‘price monitoring' practices concerning ‘deviant' distributors in order to increase retail prices for ‘problematic toys' and realign retail prices quickly. This was evidenced by numerous errata published by distributors to correct – and systematically increase - prices a posteriori in their Christmas catalogues.  Fines were imposed on three distributors which also actively participated in these monitoring practices: · This was notably the case of Carrefour, which set up a promotional campaign called ‘Carrefour reimburses the difference times 10' for several successive years, thus encouraging consumers to monitoring prices on its behalf. Using information obtained when reimbursing consumers, Carrefour systematically asked the relevant suppliers to ‘solve the problem' caused by the lower prices offered by its competitors. · This was also the case of MaxiToys, which repeatedly accepted to raise prices at the request of its suppliers, although it benefited from lower purchase prices by sourcing its requirements in the Benelux. In this respect, a Director from MaxiToys indicated during the investigation that ‘ In order to avoid that MaxiToys disrupts the French market, French toy manufacturers provide us with their French purchase prices and ask that we align [our own prices] on the French threshold for below cost pricing. This avoids market disruption and allows us to obtain higher margins and consequently to make some money'. · Finally, this was also the case of EPSE, JouéClub's network leader, which participated in Goliath's and MegaBrands' price monitoring practices in 2002. The Conseil considered that the relevant distributors could not justify their demands for suppliers to obtain that their competitors increase prices, based on laws prohibiting below cost pricing. Such justification was deemed all the more moot that investigations resulted in numerous pieces of evidence, concerning the overall sector, showing that thresholds for below cost pricing had been artificially raised (identical below cost pricing threshold in all retail outlets, regardless of the distributor, unsubstantial description of services provided by distributors as part of their ‘business cooperation', which were neither specific enough nor individualised, thus making it impossible to verify that services allegedly rendered had been truly performed, description of services part of the purchase-resale act as business cooperation, rebates unduly presented as conditional). These elements also led the Conseil de la concurrence to communicate the file to the relevant commercial courts These resale price agreements prevented competition between distributors for each of the concerned brands' toys, to the detriment of consumers Prices listed in catalogues for 13 distributors (Toys'R'Us, JouéClub, KingJouet, LaGrandeRécré, PicWic, MaxiToys, Auchan, Cora, Casino, Intermarché, Leclerc, HyperU and Carrefour) and statements from the relevant distributors' show that the agreements were effectively implemented and that suppliers' prices were largely maintained by their distributors.  Consumers were deemed to have been the main victims of these infringements since the purchase of Christmas toys is significant at this time of the year. The Conseil de la concurrence considers that the practices are harmful Practices having as their object and effect to hinder free market price fixing constitute hard core restrictions of competition under both National and European laws.  In the case at hand, the infringements are all the more harmful that they were partly implemented by companies or groups with highly renowned brands, such as Hasbro, Lego or Chicco.  As regards Carrefour, the Conseil observed that ‘ using consumers, who are led to contribute without their knowledge and to their detriment to the alignment of toy prices on Carrefour's higher price, whereas the promotional campaign [‘Carrefour reimburses the difference times 10'] purported to portray the distributor as adopting an aggressive pricing policy, adds to the practice's seriousness' . . > Decision 07-D-50 of 20 December 2007, relative to practices implemented in the sector of toy distribution > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (28th January 2009) > See decision of the Cour de cassation of the 7th April 2010 (appeal made by Carrefour France) > See decision of the Cour de cassation of the 7th April 2010 (appeal made by Puériculture France) > See decision of the Cour de cassation of the 7th April 2010 (appeal made by Hasbro France) > See decision of the Cour de cassation of the 7th April 2010 (appeal made by Maxi Toys France)",

These practices, which lasted for varying periods of time depending on the unions, took place between the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2005. The unions had issued recommendations encouraging Sector 1 specialist physicians to increase their fees The Conseil de la concurrence found that the union organizations involved had encouraged Sector 1 private practice specialist physicians to increase their fees, by using collective, widespread and sometimes routine “one-time overcharging” to make up for the fact that the government health management agency had not increased the amount they are contractually authorized to charge patients. The one-time overcharging practice, which was supposed to be used “with restraint and on a limited basis”, in theory allowed Sector 1 specialist physicians to charge fees higher than those contractually authorized when the services were provided during special circumstances, in terms of the time or the place due to the patient's special needs. In its analysis, the Conseil held that the fact that medical unions issued collective recommendations to use the right to overcharge patients for the purpose of artificially inflating fees, when such practice was intended to be used when deemed appropriate by individual practitioners, constituted an agreement on prices. These practices long affected the health services industry and resulted in patients being overcharged almost €180 million over the period in question These practices, which continued for varying lengths of time depending on the unions, were widely used by physicians, thereby causing significant economic damage to the sector, borne primarily by patients due to the hike in fees. The Conseil estimated the amount in overcharge at 180 million euros. While the Conseil has no intention of challenging the legitimate efforts of unions, those efforts must not take on the form of concerted action between service providers resulting in a significant increase of the prices for services provided. Seven unions were fined a total of €814,000  The Conseil de la concurrence issued proportionate fines reflecting the seriousness of the conduct in question, the amount of damage caused to the economy and the circumstances specific to each organization as well their financial capacities. It issued: - UMESPE with a fine of €150,000  - CSMF with a fine of €220,000  - FMF with a fine of €34,000  - SML with a fine of €135,000  - SYNGOF with a fine of 200,000  - SNPP with a fine of €37,000  - SNPF with a fine of €38,000  ). > > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (18th March 2009) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (7th April 2010)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence orders Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique to amend its contracts to allow distributors to sell its products online > Version française The Conseil has issued a decision, ruling that Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique breached competition law by prohibiting its authorized distributors from selling Klorane, Avène, Ducray and Galenic branded products over the Internet. Background of the case and the offending practices committed by Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique  Like most companies operating in its sector, Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique has opted for a system of selective distribution: its products are sold through authorized distributors (pharmacies, parapharmacies, etc.), selected according to the quality of their point of sale, the qualifications of their staff and their commitment to guarantee that a pharmacist will be present at all times. This latter criterion is deemed necessary in order for products to be sold.  Without calling into question the principle of selective distribution, the Conseil de la concurrence, having launched ex officio proceedings in 2006, had previously expressed competition concerns regarding clauses prohibiting authorized distributors from selling products online. This is why ten companies gave the Conseil a commitment to amend their contracts, in such a way as to ensure respect for their corporate image and the guaranteed quality of their products, whilst allowing authorized distributors to take advantage of this dynamic retail channel. These proceedings against them were closed in March 2007 (see press release dated 8 March 2007). By prohibiting the sale of its products online, Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique placed excessive restrictions on the commercial freedom of its distributors, to the detriment of consumers' interests Ruling on the case of Pierre Fabre, which did not wish to benefit from the same negotiated procedure such as the other companies, and without being bound by its previous decision in which no legal qualification of the facts was established, the Conseil de la concurrence has taken the view that Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique, by prohibiting the online sale of its products, has broken competition rules: this practice equates to a prohibition of active and passive sales, and cannot be considered exempt, either under a block exemption allowed by the EC Regulation of 1999 on vertical agreements, or individually under national and EC provisions allowing for the agreement's contribution to economic development to be taken into account.  Pierre Fabre DC has harmed the interests of consumers by preventing them from enjoying the pro-competition effects that may be expected from the online sale of products distributed through a selective network, and has restricted the commercial freedom of its authorized distributors, by depriving them of a marketing channel with strong growth potential.  This method of distribution not only allows consumers to compare prices more easily, but also offers them services that sales in physical outlets are unable to provide. Home delivery and real time availability of product-specific documentation, in any location, serve to stimulate price competition whilst giving distributors an incentive to provide more services in order to attract or retain custom. The Conseil believes selective distribution networks offer sufficient guarantees to a brand concerned with protecting its prestige and reputation The Conseil reiterates that parapharmaceutical products are not medicines, and that the selective organization of distribution through specialist networks is sufficient to guarantee respect for product quality.  It also takes the view that the selection criteria for the selective distribution system defined by Pierre Fabre DC, intended to enhance the value of its products, can be adapted to Internet sites. The Conseil has acted to restore proper competition quickly, ordering Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique to remove, in its selective distribution contracts, any section effectively prohibiting Internet sales of its cosmetics and personal hygiene products. All points of sale must be informed of this amendment, which shall be applied within a period of three months. Given the circumstances of the case and the expected effect of the injunctions handed down, the Conseil has limited the fine imposed on Pierre Fabre Dermo-cosmétique to 17,000 euros. > For more details of decision 08-D-25  > See decision of the Paris court of Appeal (29th October 2009) > See decision of the European Court of Justice (13th October 2011)",

The anticompetitive practice led to a rise in the cost of refuelling services for Air France at its stopovers in Reunion Documents seized during searches conducted in Paris, Reunion and London revealed that the offending oil companies colluded in 2002 to share the market launched by Air France and guarantee their respective market shares. By acting jointly to restrict the volumes offered, they gave Air France no other option but to accept all four offers, without being able to reject any one or negotiate prices, in order to satisfy its fuel requirements.  This practice led to a significant rise in the cost of refuelling services for Air France at this stopover (+30%) over the period 2002-2003. Cooperation with the UK Office of Fair Trading: a first within the European Competition Network For the first time, the Conseil de la concurrence sought the assistance of the British competition authority, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), to carry out searches in the UK, where several of the companies involved in this practice have their headquarters. Without this collaboration, a lack of evidence would have prevented the investigation from being carried through to completion. The success of this coordinated effort demonstrates the highly active cooperation that has existed between national competition authorities and with the European Commission, since EU Regulation 1/2003 came into force on 1st May 2004. Penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the infringements and the extent of the damage caused to the economy The fines imposed break down as follows: Chevron Group: 10 million euros Total Group: 9.9 million euros (Total Outre Mer: 4.4 million and Total Réunion: 5.5 million) Esso Group: 10.7 million euros Shell Group: 10.5 million euros These sums will go to the public treasury.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Conseil de la concurrence fines 11 trading companies and the main industry association a total of 575.4 million Euros Version française  Following complaints by customers of steel trading groups, regarding suspicious similarities in bids received in response to consultations, the Minister of Economy ordered an administrative inquiry in May 2004. The results of that inquiry were passed on to the Conseil de la concurrence in July 2005. In October 2006, one of the companies under investigation opted to take advantage of the French leniency programme (see the Conseil de la concurrence's procedural notice dated 17th April 2007, which can be found online at www.conseil-concurrence.fr ) and cooperate with the investigation by coming forward with new information. Today, the Conseil de la concurrence has handed down a decision penalizing eleven steel trading companies and the main industry association, the Fédération Française de Distribution des Métaux (FFDM, French Federation of Metals Distribution), for setting up a hardcore cartel between mid-1999 and mid-2004, that affected prices, customers and contracts. The illegal agreement was organized under cover of professional association activity, following the initiative of the three main French trading groups: PUM/Arcelor (Arcelor Mittal Group), KDI (a subsidiary of the German group Kloeckner) and Descours & Cabaud (trading group based in Lyons). A large cartel The inquiry and investigation revealed that the cartel covered all of France and lasted for five years, although some of the companies involved were party to the offence for a shorter period. Documents and other case evidence showed that the offending companies held numerous and regular meetings, at which they agreed on the commercial terms offered to customers (fixing price schedules, classifying customers according to their potential, imposing maximum discounts, etc.) and divided up customers and contracts between them. A sophisticated cartel The cartel was particularly well organized and controlled by the offending companies, who took into account all the particularities of the market in a highly sophisticated arrangement. They organized numerous meetings at various levels, from national to regional and local, with varying frequencies. Meetings focused on specific products and established multiple price schedules. Minutes were circulated and compliance with the decisions taken was monitored regularly, whilst bodies were set up to oversee and support the practices, and penalties were imposed on those who \"broke\" the agreed rules. The cartel operated through \"proposers\" and \"pilots\" acting right across France, which was divided into 11 regions, presided by a \"chairman\", according to terminology used in seized documents. Companies which failed to comply with the agreements suffered \"penalties\", including temporary exclusion from the cartel. This threat is well illustrated in one of the documents reproduced in full in the decision, summarizing the \"penalties\" applied in region 7 in the event of \"deviation\" (refer to paragraph 164, pages 66 to 68): \"tonnage repurchase\", \"bid withdrawal\", \"right of redress\" accorded to injured companies, etc. The rules of the agreement could also be suspended temporarily, in order to maintain the cartel's long-term stability against outside parties and to conceal the practices from customers, who were sent covering bids to simulate the existence of competition. Exceptionally serious infringements The offences are exceptionally serious, as they had the intention and the effect not only of distorting normal price competition, but also of sharing customers and contracts, thereby obliterating any competitive mechanism between the companies involved. In addition, the cartel covered a very large part of the market (around 70 to 90% of volumes sold through trading on almost all of the products concerned). Also, it was orchestrated from the very highest levels of the companies concerned, which were fully aware that they were behaving illegally, as demonstrated by instructions appearing in seized documents (\"never mention the words agreement or cartel\", \"never disclose information about our meetings\", \"avoid talking about the colleagues\", etc). Very substantial damage to the economy: steel products are widely used by many customers The damage caused to the economy runs into hundreds of millions of Euros, affecting customers in the market concerned but also in other downstream markets. The products concerned (beams, tubes, rolls, reinforcing bars, etc.) are intermediate goods used by companies of all sizes in a variety of industries, including construction, civil engineering, sheet metal working and the naval industry. They are also used by SMEs (locksmiths, etc.), whose requirements are too small for them to obtain supplies directly from producers, and who are therefore obliged to go through traders. In such cases, overpricing at the top end of the production chain is at least partly passed on to operators lower down, thereby increasing the end price paid by consumers. The agreement was also intended to prevent more competitive operators from gaining a foothold in the market. Penalties The Conseil granted Descours & Cabaud partial exemption from fines, under the leniency procedure. In addition, following the statement of objections, the companies PUM Service Acier, Arcelor Profil, AMD Sud Ouest and KDI, along with the FFDM, opted not to contest the case against them and agreed to offer commitments intended to prevent any repeat of the offences. Consequently, their fines were reduced (under the \"negotiated settlement\" procedure). After application of these procedures, the total amount of the fines imposed was reduced from 716,450,000 to 575,454,500 Euros. They break down as follows: Arcelor Mittal Group: 301,780,000 Euros (PUM Service Acier: 288,000,000 Euros; Arcelor Profil: 12,950,000 Euros and AMD Sud Ouest: 830,000 Euros); KDI: 169,300,000 Euros; Descours & Cabaud SA: 82,550,000 Euros; Marc Morel et Fils: 12,000,000 Euros; Maisonneuve: 8,000,000 Euros; Clisson Métal: 800,000 Euros; Liametho: 400,000 Euros; CODIP: 400,000 Euros; Ferren Fers: 100,000 Euros; FFDM: 124,500 Euros. At the session before the Conseil, several of the companies fined indicated that they could face difficulties as a result of the economic crisis that developed during the second half of 2008. The Conseil took account of the context – which may affect the companies' ability to pay – and reiterated that if the companies are able to demonstrate particular difficulties in paying their fines, they are entitled to request a payment schedule or deadlines from the public accounting officer responsible for collecting the fines. > For more details of decision 08-D-32 dated 16th December 2008  > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (19th January 2010)",

The Conseil also imposed a fine of 500,000 euros on Expedia. SNCF has made substantial commitments regarding its future behaviour, which will make it much easier for travel agencies to sell rail tickets online. The online travel agencies will be able to market all SNCF's promotional offers, and allow Internet users to print out their own rail tickets by themselves Until now, SNCF didn't grant travel agencies the technical conditions needed to enable them to market certain promotional offers properly (last minute offers or high-speed intercity services (TGV) at discount rates), or use the \"Print Ticket\" feature, which is particularly popular with Internet users.  Following the commitments made by SNCF, the travel agencies will from now on be on an equal footing with the website voyages-sncf.com for selling rail tickets: travellers will now have access to the same promotions and features as those available on the SNCF's own commercial website. SNCF has also given guarantees regarding its future behaviour, with a commitment to offer the same features and functions to all travel agencies when the next technological advance is rolled out, i.e. the dematerialization of rail tickets (phasing out of physical “paper” tickets). Online travel agencies will have easier access to SNCF's booking system  To sell rail tickets, online travel agencies were until now forced to purchase an expensive computer licence from SNCF in order to access its booking system. This requirement did not apply to its subsidiary Voyages-sncf.com, which enjoyed a direct connection.  SNCF has made the commitment to significantly lower the price of the licence, and also to allow the other online travel agencies to use the same connection system as Voyages-sncf.com, should they so request. In the longer term, it has also committed itself to negotiate with third party intermediaries (booking engines) to ask them to develop a new procedure for accessing its booking system, for the benefit of online travel agencies. This will give online travel agencies the choice of whether or not to use SNCF's computerized services. This commitment resolves not only the existing competition problems, but also any future issues, since it should help centralize all the rail ticket offers available on neutral platforms (booking engines), for the benefit of all travel agencies. This development will promote competition by giving greater visibility to the rail companies who enter the French market, when the international travel market is opened up to competition. > For more details of this case, see the full text of Decision 09-D-06    > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (23rd February 2010) > See decisions of Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 10th May 2011.

Santéclair is a company that provides specialist complementary health cover services for insurance companies and mutual insurance societies. Ownership of the company is split principally between AGF on the one hand, and Maaf santé and MMA on the other. In the case of dental treatment, its business mainly involves building a network of partner dental surgeons, who commit to a number of measures aimed at keeping down treatment costs and developing patient services (for example, promoting access to the \"tiers-payant\" or \"third party payment\" system where insurance companies settle treatment and pharmacy costs directly). The National Board of the French Dental Surgeons Association, relayed by a number of regional boards, encouraged dental surgeons to abandon their partnership with Santéclair, leading them to understand that they may incur penalties in the event of disciplinary proceedings Initially, the National Board issued a favourable opinion concerning the partnership proposed by Santéclair, which it deemed to be in line with deontological rules. Subsequently, following incidents, it withdrew its favourable opinion and, supported by several regional boards, encouraged dental surgeons to abandon their partnership with Santéclair, leading them to understand that they if they remained with the company, they may incur penalties in the event of disciplinary proceedings. The Conseil de la concurrence took the view that the National Board of the Order of Dental Surgeons and the regional boards had given dental surgeons inaccurate information on the scope of the negative opinion ultimately reached by the Order, since deontological opinions of this kind are not legally binding and do not bind disciplinary bodies called upon to rule on such matters. The call to boycott Santéclair also harmed the interests of patients, by hindering the emergence of new services for those with complementary health insurance By pressuring dental surgeons to leave or refrain from joining the Santéclair network - without restricting itself to giving them its opinion or, on the contrary, taking nominative disciplinary action if it deemed necessary - the National Board of the Order of Dental Surgeons and the regional boards concerned committed a practice similar to a boycott, with the aim of forcing Santéclair out of the market. The case elements show that the messages issued by the National Board did indeed lead significant numbers of dental surgeons to abandon the Santéclair agreement. The boycott also harmed the interests of patients, by hindering the emergence of new services for those with complementary health insurance, such as the possibility of access to healthcare professionals offering lower rates. > For more details of this case, see the full text of Decision 09-D-07  > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (19th January 2010) > The ruling was appealed to the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of appeals)",

Retirement homes must remain free to put pharmacies in competition in order to seek out the best prices, benefits and services  When comparing pharmacies one may consider the quality of the services (accuracy, timeliness, range of products stocked...) and the price of certain non-refundable products as well as other refundable products for which the pharmacists retain the ability to vary their profit margin. The pressure exerted by the Basse-Normandie Regional Council on the ‘ Les Hauts de Monceaux ' retirement home in urging it to obtain its supplies from the nearest pharmacies, prevents this retirement home from carrying out a legitimate search for the best priced pharmaceutical products and services by putting several pharmacies in competition.  Although the French Public Health Code ( Code de la santé publique ) aims at ensuring an adequate \"territorial network\" of pharmacies in order to respond to the needs of the population, it does not establish a territorial monopoly and does not imply that a retirement or care home cannot make competition play and request the pharmacist of its choice to satisfy the requirements of its residents. An practice resulting in a fine of 5,000 euro  The Autorité de la concurrence has deemed that the practice reproached to the Regional Council of the Ordre des pharmaciens de Basse-Normandie is serious since it is carried out by an institution which has been assigned a responsibility of public service. Furthermore, although an isolated conduct, this approach illustrates a position in principle tending to encourage a division of the clientele of the pharmacies into immediate proximity markets. This tends to restrict competition between the dispensing pharmacists and to cause damage to the economy in as much as it disrupts the economic order. This is why the Autorité de la concurrence has levied on the Regional Council of the Ordre des pharmaciens de Basse-Normandie a fine of 5,000 euro. In order to inform pharmacists and managers of retirement homes about the prohibited nature of this practice, the Autorité de la concurrence has asked the Regional Council of the Ordre des pharmaciens de Basse-Normandie to publish a summary of the decision in the review “ Le Moniteur des pharmaciens ” and in the issues of the “ Ouest France ” newspaper distributed in Basse-Normandie.

The administration looks after the financial cost of relocating soldiers The relocation of military personnel is governed by specific regulatory provisions that require the latter to provide the administration with two or three competing estimates for the purpose of reimbursement of all, or part of, a relocation related to a unit transfer. Actually, the soldier contacts the furniture remover, pays the agreed price but, in the end, is not responsible for the cost of the relocation. Taking advantage of this “painless” system and of the “captive” nature of the demand, the companies in question often avoided competing with one another by producing fake estimates, to the detriment of public accounts The inspection brought to light that the companies were not competing in many cases, while in reality sharing the customers. They drafted “fake” estimates (offers with a deliberately higher amount) so that one of them would certainly secure the business for the relocation of a given transferred soldier. The Autorité has estimated that these practices were serious: faced with a captive clientele confronted with the need to join the new unit by a given date and in the presence of an administration whose first concern was the proper operation of the movement of military personnel, the professionals in question artificially distributed the customers amongst themselves, thereby limiting competition and hindering the setting of prices through the working of the market. The facts are all the more regrettable since similar efforts had already been sanctioned in this sector, and that the companies in question in the present matter could not have been unaware of the prohibited nature and seriousness of such practices (notably see the decisions of the Conseil de la Concurrence 07-D-48 of 18 December 2007, confirmed by the Paris court of appeal on 25 February 2009, 02-D-62 of 27 September 2002, 01-D-63 of 9 October 2001 and 99-D-50 of 13 July 1999).

        "full_text_press_realease": "After a referral by Bouygues Télécom Caraïbe and then by Outremer Télécom, the Autorité de la concurrence just issued a decision in which it fines Orange Caraïbe and France Telecom in the amount of 63 million euros for having used anticompetitive practices on the mobile telephony, or fixed telephony (calls to mobiles), market in the West Indies-Guyana zone. History of the procedure: interim measures applied in 2004 Pending its decision on the merits of the case, the Conseil de la Concurrence imposed emergency measures in 2004 (decision 04-MC-02), while ordering Orange Caraïbe to end certain practices pointed out in the complaint. This decision was confirmed by the Paris Court of Appeal (ruling of 28 January 2005): the operator accordingly modified its commercial policy. After having examined the affair on the merits, the Autorité de la concurrence now fines Orange Caraïbe and France Telecom on the basis of national and European Community competition rules. The practices of Orange Caraïbe hindered the development of competition in the mobile telephony sector Orange Caraïbe is the incumbent operator in the West Indies-Guyana zone: at the time of the events, its market share in mobile telephony services was more than 75%. In order to maintain its position, it implemented a series of practices that were all intended to, or that served to, handicap the arrival of competing operators, or to make their development more difficult: • Exclusivity agreements with independent distributors , thereby appreciably limiting the marketing possibilities for any new operator, by increasing its entry costs in a sector that is specifically characterized by high fixed costs (from 2000 to 2005). • Exclusivity clauses signed with the only approved repair centre for handsets in the Caribbean , thereby preventing any new operator from providing its customers with a local maintenance service, at the risk of damaging the latter's image (from April 2003 to January 2005). • Set-up of the \"Changez de mobile\" loyalty-building programme , through which Orange Caraïbe customers could only use their loyalty points for the acquisition of a new handset, under the condition of a renewed 24-month commitment with Orange Caraïbe. This fidelity mechanism served to dissuade consumers from benefiting from competition at the only moment when they could do so, i.e. at the end of the commitment period (from 2002 to 2005). • Improper rate differentiation practices between \"on net\" calls (to its network) and \"off net\" calls (to a competing network), that served to artificially strengthen the network effect for the benefit of Orange Caraïbe (\"club effect\"), while helping to damage the image and earnings of the competing operator, viewed as more expensive (between 2003 and 2004). By continuing to market the \"Avantage Améris\" option and through the use of margin squeeze practices, France Telecom improperly favoured its subsidiary Orange Caraïbe relative to its competitors From 2000 to May 2002, France Telecom marketed a free rate option that offered discounts (volume-based) to professionals, companies, local and regional administrations and self-employed people, for land-line calls going only to the Orange Caraïbe network. While this option was no longer marketed after May 2002, customers continue to benefit from it until the start of 2006. Moreover, in 2004, France Telecom marketed \"land-line to mobile\" telecommunication offers to local and regional administrations as well as to companies, at costs below what an equally efficient operator would be able to bear in order to offer the same service (margin squeeze). A fine justified by the seriousness of the practices and the significant nature of the damages caused to the economy as suffered by Caribbean consumers Orange Caraïbe, which enjoyed a de facto monopoly situation in the West Indies-Guyana zone from 1996 to the end of 2000, was able to strengthen a particularly solid market position, which was further enhanced by its attachment to the France Telecom group. The implemented practices served to delay the development of competition within this zone, to the detriment of Caribbean consumers. With regard to the practices claimed specifically against France Telecom (\"Avantage Améris\" and margin squeeze), the Autorité took into account the fact that they only involved a limited number of customers, or tailor-made offers. A joint conviction of France Telecom and Orange Caraïbe In application of European Community case law, for their practices on the mobile telephony market, the Autorit é jointly and severally fines Orange Caraïbe and France Telecom, which together form a single company for the purposes of European law. The penalty amounts to 52,5 million euros. The practices carried out specifically by France Telecom are fined in the amount of 10,5 million euros. These amounts include a 50% surcharge due to repeated infringement, as a result of similar violations of competition law already committed by France Telecom. > For more details, consult the full text of the decision 09-D-36",

        "full_text_press_realease": "When the electronic communication sector was opened to competition, the fixed telephony, mobile telephony and high speed Internet access markets developed relatively independently. In recent years, however, the market actors seem to be focusing on convergence strategies between these various markets, whether through diversification, merger or partnership operations. Current events in the sector have recently shown that this convergence is starting to make its way onto the commercial level. Some operators, simultaneously active in the high speed and mobile telephony markets, are implementing new marketing methods known under the name of \"cross-selling\", which involves soliciting their database of mobile users in order to offer high speed Internet access offers, or vice versa, which can, if relevant, take the shape of bundled offers at an attractive price. \"Cross-selling\", a means for certain mobile operators to strengthen their position on the high speed market These new practices seem to have benefited to the actors that have implemented them. This is particularly the case of the operators SFR and Bouygues Télécom, that, in the last three quarters, have recruited new subscribers for the high speed Internet access market at an unusually high rhythm. Inversely, the operators France Telecom-Orange and Free have seen their results in this market deteriorate during the same period. However, the latter indicate that they do not use \"cross-selling\" practices: France Telecom – Orange because of uncertainty as to how these practices would be considered in view of competition law; Free because it does not currently have a database of mobile subscribers. In this context, the Autorité de la concurrence intends to examine the matter of the cross-usage of clientele databases and, notably, to assess the effects that this could have on the high speed and mobile markets Initially, the opinion will examine how this practice can, looking beyond the mere sector of electronic communications, be assessed in view of competition law. On the one hand, companies building on their own strengths is part of what drives competition and can therefore be a normal operating element for the markets. On the other hand, however, this same usage could, in certain cases, result in entry barriers on either one of the two markets in question. Secondly, the opinion will consider the specific question of the response right of a company that has a dominant position on one of the markets in question, or on a related market. Thirdly, the opinion will strive to set down principles that will have arisen from the convergence context that is characterizing the electronic communications sector. Notably in view of this last element and of the context in which the present decision will be issued, the Autorité will seek an opinion from the French Telecommunications and Posts Regulator (Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques et des postes - ARCEP) in order to obtain more information on the stakes specific to the electronic communications sector.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence accepts the commitments of Apple and Orange and makes them compulsory > Version française  In early November 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence had received commitment proposals from Apple and France Telecom, and had published them on its website in order to gather the observations of interested third parties (for more information, see the market test and press release published on 3 November 2009). After examining them, the Autorité de la concurrence has decided to accept these commitments subject to several adjustments, that it obtained during the hearing, in order to clarify and improve the submitted proposals. As such, it is now issuing a decision that renders them compulsory and that closes the litigation procedure that had been launched against Apple and France Telecom. As a reminder, on 17 December 2008 (1) , pending a decision on the merits, interim measures had been imposed so as to ensure that iPhone products would no longer be marketed and sold solely by Orange, but rather by any other operator that wished to put together an offer using this handset ( decision confirmed by the Paris Court of Appeal on 4 February 2009 ). The commitments of Apple and Orange The commitments proposed by Apple and Orange aim at answering to the competition concerns that had been brought to light by the Case Officer during his preliminary assessment. These concerns revolved around the exclusivity granted by Apple to Orange for the marketing and sale of the iPhone on French territory, and did not relate to the other aspects of the contracts signed between Apple and mobile telephone operators, on which the Autorité made no comment. With regard to the issue of exclusivity, the proposed commitments confirm the situation that resulted from the application of the injunctions that had been imposed as interim measures. These commitments firstly allowed SFR and Bouygues Télécom to sign contracts with Apple relative to the distribution of the 3G, and now 3GS iPhone, and secondly they suspended the wholesaler exclusivity of Orange. • Apple undertakes , \" for a period of three years as of the publication of the future decision on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence, not to conclude and/or implement, with mobile telephone operators, any operator exclusivity or wholesaler agreement relative to the distribution, throughout all or part of French territory, of current or future models of the iPhone, with the exception of exclusivity agreements relating to future models of the iPhone, the non-renewable duration of which cannot be greater than three months for each new model .\" • For its part, Orange undertakes : - \" for a period of three years as of the publication of the future decision on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence, not to implement with Apple, on French territory or any part thereof, any operator exclusivity or wholesale agreement relating to the distribution of the current iPhone models.\" - \"for a period of three years as of the publication of the future decision on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence, not to conclude and/or implement, with Apple, any operator exclusivity or wholesaler agreement relative to the distribution, throughout all or part of French territory, of future models of the iPhone, with the exception of non-renewable exclusivity agreements, the duration of which cannot be greater than three months for each new model.\" - \"to bring the iPhone distribution contracts of its distributors into line with decision n° 08-MC-01, and to do so within two months of the publication of the future decision on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence, so as to confirm the deletion of the clauses that had been suspended on a temporary basis pursuant to article 3 of this decision. This modification will require the distributors to be informed of the inapplicability and deletion of the said clauses. Orange will keep the Autorité de la concurrence informed regarding the implementation of this commitment, within three months of the publication date of the future decision on the website of the Autorité de la concurrence, by providing the Autorité with copies of its notification letters .\" To consult the full text of decision 10-D-01 of 11 January 2010, relative to the practices implemented in the distribution of iPhones, please visit the Internet site of the Autorité de la concurrence: www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr (1) Decision 08-MC-01 of 17 December 2008 from the Conseil de la concurrence.

The latter had launched an initiative which, under certain conditions, would provide persons over 16 years of age with replacement glasses without the need for a prescription, with the insured person also receiving a better reimbursement. The MAAF-Santéclair initiative Considering the low level of Social Security coverage of certain healthcare expenses (notably dental and optical), many supplementary health insurance institutions (OCAM) have established partnerships with healthcare professionals. Within this framework, the partner healthcare professionals undertake to provide the insured persons with certain services (set-up of a third party payer system, sometimes rate reductions...). In return, policyholders of the OCAM in question are encouraged to deal with healthcare professionals that are members of the network. It is in this context that, in late 2003, the MAAF - one of the supplementary health insurance institutions (OCAM) using the Santéclair network - undertook to provide its policyholders over 16 years of age with a 100% reimbursement of the price of replacement glasses acquired without a prescription from an optician member of the Santéclair network, provided that the insured person's situation did not require a consultation with an ophthalmologist. The call for boycott of the SNOF In response, between December 2003 and April 2004, by means of circulars and letters, the French national association of ophthalmologists (Syndicat national des ophtalmologistes de France - SNOF) called for a boycott of opticians that had signed a contract of partnership with Santéclair. In particular, it prompted its members to warn patients with regard to the potential risks to their health from dealing directly with opticians without first consulting with an ophthalmologist. Practices that are damaging to the development of approved health care networks and to patients Pressure from the SNOF led a certain number of opticians to terminate their partnership contracts with Santéclair and hindered the dynamic of development of these approved networks, despite the fact that the latter are favourable for competition and in the interests of patients, as already indicated by the Autorité de la concurrence  . It is the second time that the Autorité sanctions practices of this type. In February 2009, the National council of the order of dental surgeons (Conseil national de l'Ordre des chirurgiens-dentistes), and several of its regional councils, were sanctioned for having encouraged dental surgeons to avoid any partnership with the Santéclair company.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence sanctions two anticompetitive practices involving container handling companies in the harbour of Le Havre > Version française   After a referral by the company AP Moller-Maersk (APMM) and a self-referral, the Autorité de la concurrence issues a decision in which it applies sanctions in the amount of €625,000 on four port handling companies : • for having coordinated, between three of them, in order to share dockside stations that were being built as part of the current extension of the capacity of the harbour of Le Havre;  • for having divvied up, between two of the companies, the port handling clientele. Development of the harbour capacities of the harbour of Le Havre Faced with the saturation of its harbour capacities, the port of Le Havre launched an extension project in the 1990s. The “Port 2000” project is intended to develop its infrastructures by building 12 new dockside stations where handling companies involved in the loading and unloading of merchandise from ships would be able to operate. By 2006, four dockside stations had been constructed and were being operated by the handling companies Terminal Porte Océane and Générale Manutention Portuaire. The remaining area of the Port 2000 project was still to be allocated. Under the aegis of the harbour of Le Havre, the handling companies met in order to agree on the allocation of the available quayside stations between them During the meetings organised by the port establishment of Le Havre, the handling companies already operating terminals in the harbour of Le Havre (Terminal Porte Océane, Terminal Normandie MSC and Générale Manutention Portuaire), met on three occasions in 2006 in order to agree on how the available stations should be distributed between them. As such, the objectives of these meetings, referred to as “Yalta” by some of the participants, were to distribute the facilities. However, the Autorité only applied symbolic sanctions in order to take into account two mitigating factors: firstly, the real effects of the collusion were modest insofar as open competition for the allocation of port capacities has not yet been carried out and, pursuant to the regulatory provisions adopted in 2008, it will be undertaken by means of an open and transparent allocation procedure and, secondly, because the meetings between competing operators have been organised by the port of Le Havre itself. The Autorité also sanctioned two companies for having limited competition between handling companies, to the detriment of shipowners The companies Perrigault and Terminal Porte Océane (TPO) have also been sanctioned for having agreed to prohibit TPO from competing with the other terminals of Le Havre, notably by means of the anticompetitive application of a non-competition clause contained in the founding agreement for the joint venture Terminal Porte Océane. In 2004, Perrigault and the shipowner APMM decided to create a joint company, TPO, for the purpose of the operation of a handling station as part of “Port 2000”. APMM had undertaken to TPO that it would provide the terminal with a guaranteed minimum contribution in terms of business volume. A non-competition clause indicated that TPO and Perrigault would refrain from soliciting their respective customers. While it had been anticipated that the joint venture would act autonomously and independently, and that it could notably “ offer its services to third party maritime companies ”, Perrigault and TPO then decided to extensively apply the non-competition clause by prohibiting TPO from entering into contract with any customer other than APMM. As such, TPO refrained from competing against the other existing terminals of the harbour of Le Havre, thereby depriving shipowners of an alternative solution to the offer of the existing handling companies. In view of these elements, the Autorité pronounced the following fines : • against the company Terminal Porte Océane, a fine of 135,000 euros; • against the company Perrigault SA, a fine of 370,000 euros; • against the company Terminal Normandie MSC, a fine of 40,000 euros; • against the company Générale de Manutention Portuaire, a fine of 80,000 euros. The Autorité also ordered Perrigault and TPO to discontinue the extensive application of the non-competition clause signed by the companies.   In 2008, the Conseil de la concurrence had rejected the request for interim measures submitted by AP Moller-Maersk, given the lack of urgency, but had continued its investigation on the merits. See decision 08-D-19 . The Autorité de la concurrence did not sanction the port of Le Havre that provided the setting for the anticompetitive behaviour of the sanctioned companies. Indeed, it considered that allocating authorisations for the occupation of the docks is an activity that cannot be dissociated from its task of operating the port's public domain, as well as an action that cannot be separated from its prerogatives as the public authority. Consequently, the Autorité de la concurrence considered that it was not competent to review the actions of the harbour of Le Havre. > For more details consult the full text of decision 10-D-13 of 15 April 2010, regarding the practices implemented in the handling sector for the transport of containers in the harbour of Le Havre   > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (20th January 2011) > The ruling was appealed to the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeals)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence orders Google to implement in an objective, transparent and non discriminatory manner the content policy of its AdWords service > Version française        The Autorité received a complaint against Google, coupled with a request for interim measures, from Navx. Navx markets online databases for GPS navigation devices. These databases include the localisation of fixed and mobile speed cameras as well as the fuel prices implemented by service stations. Navx alleged that Google was implementing anticompetitive practices on the online advertising market. In its interim decision, the Autorité considers that Google holds a dominant position on the advertising market related to online searches. Its search engine enjoys a wide popularity and currently totals around 90% of the web searches made in France . Moreover, there are strong barriers to entry for this activity. Finally, its AdWords online advertising service, which is linked to its search engine, meets a specific demand from advertisers. Pending a full investigation and a decision on the merits, the Autorité is also of the view that Google has implemented the content policy of its AdWords service in a way which lacks objectivity and transparency, resulting in a discriminatory treatment of speed camera database suppliers. The Autorité has therefore decided to grant interim measures .        Navx exclusively relies on the online sale of radar databases Navx is a start-up created in 2005, which markets point of interest databases for GPS and smartphones, mainly in a package (“Navx Trio Pack”) including the localisation of fixed and mobile speed cameras as well as the fuel prices implemented by service stations. It sells its products either directly to individual customers (two-thirds of its turnover) or to GPS manufacturers such as TomTom or Garmin, who integrate them into their own navigation devices (one-third of its turnover). For the sale of speed camera databases, Navx is in competition with GPS manufacturers and with other independent businesses. 85% of its communications expenses are related to online advertising via AdWords, a service offered by Google. Google operates an Internet search engine, within which Adwords provides online advertising space. AdWords is based on a bidding process for the purchase of keywords. In practice, advertisers bid on keywords (for instance in the present case, “speed camera database” or “speed camera warning systems”), in order for their commercial link to appear next to or above the results of Google search engine, when these keywords are part of the request made by an Internet user. The advertiser then pays for every \"click\" made on its commercial link. Online advertising is a favourite sale channel for Navx, which markets digital files, due to the fact that there exists a strong continuity between the act of browsing the Internet and the act of purchase: commercial links appear on the screen as a result of the search and customers can then reach directly the commercial website and buy the product at stake in a few minutes.       Navx's complaint Navx complains in particular of the sudden breaking off of its contract and of a discriminatory treatment on part of Google. In 2008, Google decided to modify, in a more restrictive fashion, its content policy for devices aimed at evading road traffic speed cameras (1). The wording of its general conditions however lacks in clarity regarding the possibility that is open (or not) to manufacturers of speed camera databases to continue to advertise. Whereas until the beginning of November 2009, advertisements subject to automatic cancellation had been restored on simple request from Navx t, Google finally decided unilaterally to suspend Navx's account. It is only 4 days after this suspension that Google informed Navx in writing, on 17 November 2009, that advertising for speed camera databases and warning systems was contrary to its content policy.       If, in principle, Google remains free to define its content policy for admission to its AdWords service, it is important to implement this policy in a transparent and objective fashion, that does not result in a discriminatory treatment of some market operators The facts brought to the knowledge of the Autorité, at the current stage of the investigation, evidence a lack of objectivity and transparency concerning: the scope of the ban: the conditions do not specify clearly whether speed camera warning systems and speed camera databases are concerned or not;          the impact of the ban: advertisers do not know with sufficient certainty if the ban concerns only the use of keywords and the advertising of products in the text of the announcement or on the page accessible via the commercial link, or if it also concerns further pages accessible from the latter;          the process applicable in case of a change in the conditions: advertisers are not informed upfront of a change, nor of the date on which it becomes applicable; moreover, Google reserves the right to fine-tune its interpretation of the conditions via bilateral discussions, without changing the general conditions themselves;           the proceedings followed in case of a suspension: it can occur without any true advanced notice.       The discrimination, that flows in part from the content policy's lack of objectivity and transparency, is evidenced by the differences in the treatment applied to radar databases suppliers: between GPS manufacturers (TomTom and Garmin), which may promote the supply of these databases on their website without being excluded from the AdWords service, and speed camera warning system and speed camera databases manufacturers (SCDB, Coyote, Navx, AlerteGPS), that cannot;           in the level of information available to the advertisers: some are informed in writing and in advance of the exact impact of the conditions and interpretation thereof, so as to avoid suspension, while others are informed in writing only after the suspension of their account has occurred (case of Navx).       The interim measures granted by the Autorité Discriminatory practices may harm competition when they have for object or for effect to foreclose a competitor from the market but also when customers of a company holding a dominant position find themselves disadvantaged in the competition on their own market. Google's practices have suddenly and significantly affected Navx's income, but also and essentially its growth potential. This has made it very difficult to organise a second fund raising. Consequently, it has rendered very unlikely the continuation of the B2C activity of the company, which represents approximately two-thirds of its turnover.       In view of all these elements, the Autorité has decided to grant several interim injunctions. 1) It orders Google Ireland and Google Inc. to clarify, within a four months period following the notification of its decision, the scope and impact of the AdWords conditions applicable to devices aimed at evading traffic speed cameras:       - as regards behaviours forbidden to advertisers (keywords, text of the advertisement, destination pages, cross-references, etc.);       - as regards authorized or forbidden devices , in particular speed camera warning systems and databases. These elements must be made available to advertisers in an objective, transparent and non discriminatory fashion. In addition, the date from which the modified conditions will be applicable to advertisers must be specified. 2) It orders Google Ireland and Google Inc. to clarify, within a four months period following the notification of its decision, the AdWords processes that may lead to an advertiser's account being suspended. 3) It orders Google Ireland and Google Inc. to restore, within a five days period following the notification of its decision, the AdWords account of Navx . Google may nevertheless apply in a non-discriminatory way to Navx the AdWords conditions and procedures as clarified according to the present decision. (1) Unlike radar detectors or jammers, that are illegal, the solutions sold by manufacturers of navigation devices and speed camera databases do not violate the law. They may be either legal or illegal depending on whether or not they are likely to “reveal” or “jam” radars: detectors and database are only relying on information broadcasted by the State services and supplemented by the users. However, Google reserves the right to be more restrictive than the legislation.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following the interim measures issued by the Autorité de la concurrence last June, Google commits to modify in a more transparent and predictable way for advertisers the rules governing its online advertising service, AdWords > Version française Following a complaint filed by Navx denouncing discriminatory practices, the French Autorité de la concurrence issued last June interim measures against Google . Navx sells databases for GPS navigation devices indicating the localisation of fixed and mobile speed cameras exclusively via Internet. It uses Google's online advertising service AdWords to appear in adjacent commercial links to web searches. In November 2009, Navx' AdWords account was suspended by Google. The latter stated that its content policy for devices aimed at evading road traffic speed cameras in France had been modified in a more restrictive way. For its part, Navx complained of the sudden break off of its contract and of a discriminatory treatment from Google to its disadvantage. In its interim measures decision (see decision 10-MC-01 and its press release ), the Autorité considered that Google remained, in principle, free to define its content policy, but noted that, on the basis of the interim assessment carried out pending a review on the merits, this policy could be deemed to be implemented in a non objective, non transparent and discriminatory way, and that such behaviour harmed some suppliers of radar databases, especially Navx. Waiting for a decision on the merits, the Autorité required Google to make AdWords' rules concerning devices aimed at evading road traffic speed cameras in France as well as its policy concerning control procedures more transparent and predictable for advertisers. It also required Google to restore, within five days, Navx' AdWords account, in order to allow the company to advertise again. Pursuant to a preliminary assessment carried out on on the merits, Google proposed commitments aimed at bringing a lasting solution to the competition concerns concerning devices aimed at evading traffic speed cameras expressed by the Autorité Following the interim measures decision issued by the Autorité last June, Google restored Navx' AdWords account and proposed commitments concerning the very functioning of AdWords service. The proposals were put online on the Autorité's website in order to gather the market players' observations. The Autorité accepts and makes compulsory Google's commitments - that have been improved in relation to those initially proposed– as they address its competition concerns In view of the observations delivered by interested third parties, Google commits itself to make the functioning of its AdWords service concerning devices aimed at evading road traffic speed cameras in France more transparent and predictable for advertisers:  By making it clearer the navigation devices for which advertising is authorized or prohibited, notably for warning devices and radar databases;    By defining the scope of the prohibition , in particular whether it applies to the adverts' content only or if it also applies to the advertiser's destination pages or cross-referenced pages as well as to the use of keywords;     By introducing a procedure of information and notification targeted to the companies concerned regarding the modifications made to AdWords content policy (more restrictive changes have to be announced three-months notice, except for specific cases mentioned in the engagement decision);    By making more precise the procedure likely to lead to the suspension of an advertiser's account, in case of breach of AdWords content policy. This procedure foresees at least two stages which should include a last formal warning making the advertiser aware of the breach and of the risk of its account suspension. The commitments have been adopted for a duration of three years. They provide the concerned operators with guarantees which were not recognised in the latter system, while preserving Google's freedom to define its contents policy. By accepting the proposed commitments, the Autorité makes them binding upon Google, who undertakes to comply with them. The Autorité notes formally Google's intention to implement, in practice, the improvements and clarifications to all its AdWords contents policies In addition to the commitments proposed to the Autorité aimed at clarifying, in France, its contents policy regarding devices aimed at evading road traffic speed cameras, Google indicated to the Autorité that it will implement, for all contents admitted on the AdWords service (i.e. for all the advertisers using the AdWords services) - and in all the countries concerned – the principles of improvement and clarification which have inspired the commitments as accepted by the Autorité . The Autorité takes note of Google's intention to bring more transparency and predictability to advertisers far beyond the litigious case brought to it: it is an important step towards a more transparent framework at international level. > Please consult the full text of the decision 10-D-30 Contact press : Ingalill d'Armaillé 01 55 04 01 82 / Contact",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines 11 French banks 384.9 million euros for having charged unjustified interbank fees during the transition towards a new digital system for processing checks > Version française  Following the opening of ex officio proceedings, the Autorité de la concurrence has issued today a decision in which it fines Banque de France, BPCE , Banque postale, BNP-Paribas, Confédération Nationale du Crédit Mutuel, Crédit Agricole, Crédit du Nord, Crédit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), LCL, HSBC and Société Générale for having colluded during the transition to a new digital system for processing checks. From January 2002 to July 2007, these banks have charged an unjustified 0.043€ fee on 80% of the checks exchanged in France. For this first infringement to competition rules, the fines amount a total of € 381.1 million.  The Autorité has also fined these banks for having enforced two additional fees for ‘related services' ( services connexes said AOCT , annulation d'opérations compensées à tort or cancellation of cleared operations i.e reversals) that are still collected today. The Autorité ascertained that the level of those fees isn't proportionate to the costs incurred by the banks and has ordered their revision by taking as a benchmark the costs of the most efficient bank. For this second infringement to competition rules, the fines amount a total of € 3.8 million. On the other hand, six other fees for ‘related services' were deemed justified under competition rules by the Autorité . It assessed that they were the proper return for newly provided services by a category of banks to another (like the clearing of a blocked check) and that they compensated for cost transfers resulting from the dematerialization of the checks exchanges system (like for example checks storage). New interbank fees were raised during the transition towards the new digital system for processing checks When the new digital system for processing and clearing interbank checks was set up (system called Exchanges Check-Image hereafter ECI / see background note 1 of the press pack for more details), the main French banks met and colluded so as to define together the functioning details of the new system. Together, they decided to raise several fees - among which the Exchanges Check-Image Fee (hereafter ECIF see background note 2 of the press pack for more details). This latter fee has been charged since 2002 and should have been subject to revision after three years. It was suppressed in 2007, while the Autorité 's investigation had reached decisive milestone, and under the pressure of the ongoing proceedings.  The ECIF is a 0.043€ fee per check charged at each operation and paid by the remittent bank to the drawee bank. According to the banks, its aim was to offset fund losses caused by the acceleration of interbank clearing processes thanks to digitalization, to the detriment of drawee banks. Since then, drawee banks are debited earlier and don't have the possibility to invest the sums corresponding to their clients' checks as long as before. On the contrary, remittance banks are credited earlier and are therefore able to invest quicker the money of their clients. The Autorité de la concurrence deems the exchange check-image fee to be anticompetitive The ECIF creation, which doesn't correspond to any rendered service has artificially increased the costs for remittent banks, with the potential effect of influencing on the level of the banking service prices. The Autorité considers that there is no evidence to prove that the transition to ECI (exchanges check-image) has provoked net losses to any of the banks involved. Therefore, the justification presented by the banks of the necessity of a compensation mechanism, could not, in any event, justify the fee and this for two reasons: Fund losses caused by drawn checks were compensated by fund profits on the remitted checks and by costs savings gained by exchanges dematerialization;    The fixed character of the ECIF didn't allow to really compensate drawee banks gross losses, because these latter were linked to the average amount of the exchanged checks (and not to their number).   That is the reason why the Autorité didn't exempt that fee from competition rules. Finally, the ECIF has contributed to increase the cost of banking services Banks have passed – at least partially - that fee on to their clients, either directly by increasing checks remittance costs (this was notably the case for mass retail distribution sector's firms, remitting regularly a great number of checks), indirectly by increasing the price of other banking services (cross subsidies). The investigation has shown that banks have directly and completely passed the fee on to the French Treasury. This latter is the main client of the French central bank and the Autorité estimates the extra cost at €36 million. Finally, the Autorité underlines that, if the digitalizing of the clearing system has allowed banks to make substantial savings, neither the firms nor the consumer have been able to take full profit from this economic progress. These practices impact one of the most popular means of payment in France In France, checks remain one of the most used means of payment and accounted for 26 % of bank payments in 2006 (see background note 3 of the press pack). Furthermore, these practices have occurred in a market where competition is already weak because of the banking monopoly and of tariffs opacity (see on that purpose the Constans/Pauget report delivered to the French ministry of Economy in July 2010).  For the calculation of fines, the Autorité has taken into account the gravity and the duration of the practices (horizontal agreement, duration > 5 years) but also the following mitigating circumstances: the practices in question do not concern directly final prices ; they did occur during the transition to ECI (exchanges of check image), a general interest program, whose implementation had been supported by the French Central Bank ; they can't be mixed up with a secret cartel. The Autorité has also taken into account the damage to the economy (size of the affected market, effects on prices). It calculated that, for each cent passed on to the consumer, the increase in prices paid by consumers amounts to €220 million for the period analyzed.  Finally, the Autorité has taken into account the individual situation of each bank - notably its market power on the check market and its economic power. The Autorité has imposed a 10% increase of the fine of Crédit Agricole, le Crédit Mutuel, La Poste, les Caisses d'Epargne and BNP , because these companies have played a major role in the collusion by supporting the introduction of the fee during the pre ECI negotiations. It has also put a 20 % increase of the fine of Crédit Mutuel, Caisses d'Epargne, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, BNP and LCL that had already been fined for anticompetitive practices in 2000 (See Decision n° 00-D-28 relative to the competition situation in the property loans sector). The Autorité has implemented national but also european competition law, considering the fact that the practices may have had an impact on the freedom of establishment of foreign banks in France. The Autorité continues the investigation of another case concerning credit card interbank fees  In 2009, the Autorité has been referred to by the Fédération des entreprises du commerce et de la distribution concerning multilateral interbank fees. The investigation is under way and the decision is expected by 2011. BPCE is fined for practices implemented during the period in question by Caisses d'Epargne et Banques Populaires.

DKT, a firm trading in plastic waste for its recycling purposes, considered that it had been victim of exclusionary practices at the time of the renewal of the contract between Eco-Emballages and the regional authorities in 2005 and 2006. It referred to the Autorité de la concurrence and requested interim measures during the investigation. In its decision 09-D-12 of 18 March 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence had considered that the conditions were not met to issue urgent interim measures (decision confirmed by the Paris Court of Appeal on 11 November 2009), but decided to examine the case on the merits. The sector in question Local and regional administrations sell their separated household plastic packaging waste to buyers that, unless they recycle themselves, supply such waste to recycling companies for the manufacturing of new products (new packaging, fur for cold-weather gear, swimming pools, surfaces for sports fields, etc.).  For the local administrations, three recovery types are possible within the framework of a contract signed with Eco-Emballages for 6 years: - across the territory, they can sell at a uniform price to Valorplast, a company primarily issuing from plastics manufacturers. Valorpast then sells the separated waste to various operators for it to be recycled; - they can, since 2005, negotiate a price with a company that is a member of one of the two professional waste treatment federations (FNADE and FEDEREC); - or, finally, they can look after the trading of their waste on their own, with the help of a specialized intermediary, if relevant. DKT wished to operate in this capacity. Eco-Emballages is a firm approved as eco-organism by public authorities, to supervise the collection and reuse of packaging waste. Its task notably includes controlling, downstream of the recovery, the effective nature of waste recycling which impacts the payment of a subsidy to the local administrations aimed at covering part of the collection and separation expenses (support per separated tonne).  DKT claimed that it had been subjected to discriminatory requirements by Eco-Emballages and felt that the latter had adopted different behaviour that was detrimental to it, and intended to promote Valorplast. The Autorité de la concurrence considers that greater competition should be allowed between buyers, while making more extensive options available to the local administrations Eco-Emballages empirically granted or refused “non-objection” letters, without which a buyer had little chance of successfully approaching the authorities. Lacking in objectivity and transparency, this mechanism could serve as an entry barrier for new operators in the market for the recovery of plastic waste. Other competition issues were put raised, notably regarding the contracts rigidity which made it difficult for the administrations to change their recovery options for 6 years, as well as the lack of neutrality of Eco-Emballages in the presentation of recovery options and recyclers. The commitments of Eco-Emballages and of Valorplast  With the approach of the renewal of the Eco-Emballages approval (‘agrément') by the Ministry for Ecology, Eco-Emballages and Valorplast proposed 11 measures in order to respond to the competition concerns raised by the Autorité . These proposals were put online on the Autorité's website, in order to gather the views of interested third parties (market test of 8 April 2010). The Autorité considers that the commitments finally proposed at the end of the procedure are likely to answer its competition concerns, and that they are of a credible and verifiable nature. The most significant of them are listed below. The publication by Eco-Emballages, notably on the Internet, of an objective “vade mecum” for household plastic packaging waste recovery is an important element for developing free competition on the markets Eco-Emballages also commits itself to no longer perform a validation in principle of a recycler, while abandoning its “non-objection” procedure. The local administrations will be provided with a “vade mecum” that will help them to make an enlightened choice, thanks to a neutral presentation of the rules applicable to various recovery methods. The local administrations will be able to change recovery methods during the 6 years. Downstream competition will also be more stimulated Valorplast and Eco-Emballages committed themselves to have their contracts include, for the local administrations that had initially selected Valorplast, a termination option available after 3 years, so that they can choose another recovery method. Inversely, an administration that had originally chosen a buyer from the second or third options will be able to change for Valorplast after having ended its previous contractual commitments. The Autorité de la concurrence considers that this commitment serves to reconcile the satisfactory stimulation of competition on the markets in question and the viability of Valorplast, which is subject to special obligations. Finally, as the main buyer in France, Valorplast commits itself to offer available tonnages to recyclers that are not yet tied to it by long-term contracts. > For more details, please consult the full text of the decision 10-D-29 of 27 September 2010  ",

This case started in 2007 with the complaints (that they finally withdrew) of Groupe AB and RTL 9 laid at the Autorité (at that time : Conseil de la concurrence ). Almost at the same time in 2008, the Conseil de la concurrence started ex officio proceedings and received in November of that year a complaint lodged by France telecom. All these complaints have been joined to the same case. The facts at stake Three kinds of exclusivity clauses implemented by Groupe Canal Plus for the distribution of pay TV channels are challenged :   those concerning the distribution of channels “owned” by Canal Plus : i.e the channels produced by Canal Plus itself (except the ten channels at the disposal of third parties following the TPS/ Vivendi Universal (2006) and SFR/ Neuf Cegetel (2008) merger operations. These exclusivities are denounced in France telecom's complaint;     those concerning the distribution of “ related channels ”, i.e channels produced by firms which were at that time minority shareholders of Canal Plus France (TF1, Métropole Télévision and Lagardère) and which had been negotiated as part of the TPS/Vivendi Universal merger case;     those concerning the distribution of independent channels and which tie to Canal Plus about 30 TV channels amongst the most attractive ones produced by operators that are independent from Groupe Canal Plus (for example channels produced by Universal, Disney, Fox, Turner, such as most of the music channels owned by MTV ). France telecom is not only the view that these clauses are unlawful, but denounces also their cumulative effect: the addition of all these exclusivities would foreclose the market by hindering competitors - and notably telecoms operators – to have access to the channels wholesale market and to market pay TV offers attractive enough to lock the consumer. This case has raised an important and interesting issue about the related links between merger law and antitrust law  This question is valid only for the period before the 2nd of March 2009 : date of entry into force of the reform brought by the LME. Before that date , the Economy Minister had exclusive competence with regard to mergers whereas the Conseil had exclusive competence concerning the examination of anticompetitive practices . When he was examining a merger , the minister had no legal basis to analyze possible ancillary restraints linked to the case.  The framework is quite different today :   On the first hand, the Autorité de la concurrence is now entitled to decide both on merger operations and on antitrust practices.     On the other hand, the Autorité de la concurrence has released on the 16th of December 2009 Guidelines that foresee an examination of the ancillary restraints that are notified when analyzing a merger, like what is done at the EU level (see fiche 2, excerpt from the Guidelines). The parties implicated wanted the Autorité to close the case arguing that the exclusivities at stake were ancillary restraints linked to the merger and that challenging them would violate the acquired rights borne from the minister's authorization.  Concerning the field of acquired rights, the Autorité meets but only partially the request made to it. It is the view that only the exclusivities that have been negotiated within the framework of the “Ceres” and “Lagardère” draft agreements, because they have been notified and cleared by the minister for the economy, create acquired rights which prohibit their reexamination. In accordance with the principle of legal certainty such as implemented in the Conseil d'État case law , the acquired rights by the beneficiary of an administrative decision, cannot be withdrawn - even when this latter is unlawful – beyond a 4-months time period from the decision notification. The Autorité de la concurrence cannot challenge a posteriori exclusivity and non competition clauses which have been authorized in the decision signed the 30 of August 2006 by the economy minister who cleared the TPS/Vivendi Universal merger. The responsibility of this latter having been sought only as signatory of the “Ceres” and “Lagardère” draft agreements, Vivendi has been discharged. The Autorité de la concurrence has defined the scope of its examination  It deems itself entitled to examine : the exclusivities concerning the channels owned by Canal Plus denounced by France telecom.     certain exclusivities concerning the “ related channels ”: distribution agreements signed between Canal Plus and minority shareholders after the merger contain indeed clauses that had not been notified to the minister for the economy, with the aim of: - enlarging the distribution exclusivity of thematic channels of TF1, Métropole Télévision and Lagardère to the optical fiber network , - enlarging the distribution exclusivity to the catch-up TV services of these channels  - and to permitting to Canal Plus to keep a first sight right on every new broadcast medium planned by TF1 and Lagardère, and on every new service planned by TF1. the exclusivity clauses concluded by Canal Plus with independent channels producers . On these questions, the Autorité , which confirmed the existence of a dominant position of Canal Plus on the upstream market for Pay TV linear services (pages 50 to 65 of the decision), is the view that it has been insufficiently enlightened (pages 72 to 79 of the decision) and has requested additional information before issuing a decision on the merits. This additional investigation will notably allow the Autorité to be aware of the latest market developments.  The Autorité has immediately ruled on and rejected part of the complaints denouncing behaviors others than those linked to the exclusivities (defamation reproached by France telecom to Canal Plus, commercial behavior towards AB channels, tied practices between Canal + Le Bouquet et CanalSat offers). Within the framework of another proceedings, the Autorité is also investigating further the observation of the commitments made by Canal Plus to the minister when buying TPS and will issue its decision in the first half of 2011.  TF1 and métropole Télévision have since then sold to Vivendi the shares they held within Canal Plus France (in 2009 and 2010 respectively).  The Conseil de la concurrence was only referred to, in the cases where the minister decided to start in-depth examination.  An ancillary restraint is a restraint which is directly linked and necessary to the completion of the main operation.

        "full_text_press_realease": "In 2007, the Conseil de la concurrence (the predecessor of the Autorité de la concurrence) started ex officio proceedings on the practices existing within the vertical road signs sector, notably after having been alerted by press articles. Two other complaints by manufacturers of road signs and of security and marking equipment also joined this referral. The Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision in which it declares fines in the amount of 52.7 million euros against 8 firms in the sector for having colluded, between 1997 and 2006 to share markets for vertical road signs (permanent and temporary metal road signs), and agreed on prices. It is also fining two other firms for abuse of a dominant position in the market for plastic safety and marking equipment and reflective sheetings (€2,229,000). A very sophisticated cartel... The elements of the file brought to light the existence of collusion between road signs manufacturers. The firms included in the cartel met on a very regular basis and shared public contracts on the basis of pre-established rules contained in a document entitled “Rules”. Prices and discounts that could be applied to buyers were also indicated therein. Finally, a “blacklist” intended to exclude certain retailers viewed as undesirable had been established in order that there would be no commercial relations with the latter. Other documents entitled “Assets” stipulated, for their part, the purchase order-based contracts that should be allocated to each company in the cartel, thereby freezing each party's market share. Each company included in the “club” was required to follow its operating rules. “Indeed, this document is our Bible, and everyone has to keep to it” one director declared. In case of non-compliance, financial penalties were applied against the offender. Compensation arrangements were also anticipated in case of the cartel's “malfunction”, meaning that the public entity that had launched the competition procedure awarded the contract to a company other than the one designated to receive it. ... that covered the entire national territory for nearly 10 years The cartel covered the entire national territory, with the distribution agreements covering almost all of the contracts awarded by public authorities and the services in charge of operating motorways. These practices, dating back to 1997, only came to an end in March 2006, at which time the cartel was brought to light during a raid on a “club” meeting in a major Paris restaurant. Serious practices that impacted the public accounts The customers of the cartel's members were primarily local authorities or public organizations. By circumventing competition in a continuous and very organised manner throughout the country for a period of nearly 10 years, these practices affected the public resources to the detriment of taxpayers and entities operating road and motorways, as a result of artificially inflating amounts of the selected offers. The fines applied to the cartel (total: €52,712,000) In view of these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence has imposed fines. When determining them, the Autorité de la concurrence considered the seriousness of the practices in question, the scope of the damage to the economy and each company's individual situation (notably the length of its participation in the cartel). For four them (Lacroix Signalisation, Signaux Girod, Signaux Laporte and Aximum), the fine was increased by 20% to 25% since they had previously been fined for similar practices (repeated infringement). On the other hand, the Autorité granted a 15-25% reduction to the companies Lacroix Signalisation, Sécurité et Signalisation, Signature, Signaux Girod and Laporte Service Route for not having contested the charges brought against them and for having made substantial commitments intended to prevent the implementation of such practices in the future. 166,000 The decision also sanctions two other firms for abuse of a dominant position (total: €2,229,000) Between 2001 and 2007, Sodilor had refused to supply certain manufacturers of road signs with a plastic beacon that is indispensable in order to respond to certain invitations to tender, that it alone, together with another company, could provide as a result of the certification held by it. The Autorité applied a penalty of €259,000 that included a 20% reduction, as Sodilor did not contest the objections and made commitments likely to prevent the implementation of such practices in the future. For its part, between 2003 and 2005, 3M France had applied an opaque accreditation system as well as a schedule of discriminatory discounts on the supply of its retro-reflective plastic films. Its fine amounts to €1.97 million. The Autorité de la concurrence points out that the cartel's victims have the right to seek reparations Intended to punish violators of competition rules and to dissuade them from re-offending, in the interests of guaranteeing economic public order, fines are collected for the benefit of the Public treasury. However, public authorities and private persons who have been the cartel's victims, for example motorway operators, are also entitled to seek reparation for the losses sustained from the competent courts.

Today, subsequent to a self-referral in November 2009 on the practices within the port handling sector on Reunion Island, it is issuing a decision in which it fines the companies SAMR, SGM Manutention and Somacom, for having jointly agreed on the prices of their port handling services within the Reunion Port, for 23 years. It also calls on the Syndicat des entreprises de manutention portuaire de La Réunion (SEMPR) to stop establishing and disseminating an agreed handling rate intended for maritime companies that provide services to Reunion Island. The three handling companies were jointly setting the price invoiced to their customers Until 1987, the prices for port handling services had been set by prefectural decree. After that date, which corresponds with the entry into force of the ordinance of 1 December 1986 relative to the freedom of prices and competition, prices were no longer fixed by prefectural decree in the absence of a legal basis. The handling companies SAMR, SGM Manutention and Somacom then reached an agreement to jointly set the main element comprising the price for the handling service (referred to as the “commerce rate”) that would be invoiced to their customers. The anticompetitive agreements that continued unabated from 1987 to 2002 involved almost all of the handling activities at the Reunion Port and were strictly applied by the three companies. Penalties in principle in view of the modest size of the market in question and of the existence of mitigating circumstances The Autorité de la concurrence has fined the three firms in question, but has adjusted the amount of the fines in order to take into consideration the small size of the market in question, as well as the existence of mitigating circumstances. Indeed, the legal framework for port handling prices remained uncertain after the entry into force of the aforesaid ordinance of 1 December 1986, as the public authorities never adopted a legal framework that would serve to govern the prices of this service, while nevertheless being aware of the agreement between the companies. The Autorité has furthermore invited the public authorities to clarify the applicable price structure in order to ensure the legal certainty In 1988, a decree established an exception to the complete liberalization of the prices in this sector, while no text was thereafter adopted in order to organise how these prices would be set. > Consult the full text of decision 11-D-01 of 18 January 2011 regarding practices implemented on the port handling sector       ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Informed of the existence of criminal proceedings initiated before the Rouen Regional Court against the directors of undertakings for having participated in cartels involving the restoration of historic monuments, the Conseil de la concurrence, the predecessor of the Autorité de la concurrence, began an investigation of the file's competitive aspects in 2007. The Autorité issues today a decision in which it fines 14 undertakings a total of 10 million Euros for having shared almost all public markets for the restoration of historic monuments (churches, cathedrals, abbeys, castles, city heritage sites…) in three French regions Basse-Normandie, Haute-Normandie and Picardie. Sporadic illegal agreements were also organized in the regions Aquitaine, Bourgogne, Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Île-de-France. The undertakings shared out restoration sites and organised cover bids On the basis of the elements provided by the criminal court judge (hearings, seized documents, telephone recordings) the Autorité found that the undertakings organized « roundtables » during which the companies shared out the regional restoration building markets after consulting the annual scheduling prepared by the Direction régionale des affaires culturelles, DRAC . Ten of the 20 leading French companies in the sector took part in these cartels. The aim was to share all the region's restoration building sites between the local companies. Each one expressed its « wishes » and obtained a share of the annual amount of the DRAC markets. This sharing had a geographical rationale, with undertakings favoring sites located close to their own location in order to limit costs, as well as a rationale based on the company's history, with each one remaining on the monument upon which it was accustomed to working. The undertakings activity level – i.e. the markets already obtained - and future consultations were also taken into account. The undertakings used to exchanging information before bidding in order to “ orchestrate ” the cartels and thereby guarantee the awarding of the contract as had been decided. Cover bids were also solicited from undertakings outside of the region, notably in an effort to “ inflate the numbers ” and thereby to provide the contracting authority with what appeared to be a high degree of competition. In “exchange for this service”, the latter were then covered in turn within their respective regions. These practices drove up the price of the bids In the sector, these practices were « a tradition », according to many directors. The evidence gathered shows that the three local cartels have been in place for at least five years in Haute-Normandie (from April 1997 to February 2002), more than four years in Basse-Normandie (from December 1997 to February 2002) and nearly four years in Picardie (from February 1998 to October 2001), which thereby serve to artificially inflate the amount of the bids. As soon as these cartels were dismantled, the price for the services offered by the same undertakings dropped significantly (by an average of more than 20%). By distorting competition on almost all restoration sites in these regions , the companies had a strong effect on the public accounts, as the contracting authorities were primarily the State, sometimes on behalf of individuals or local administrations. The fines imposed total 9 803 590 M € Taking into account those elements, the Autorité decided to impose financial penalties. When determining them, the Autorité de la concurrence considered the severity of the practices in question, the scope of the damage to the economy and each company's individual situation (notably the length of its participation in the cartel). For three of them (Pradeau Morin, Lanfry and Coefficient), it granted a reduction of the penalty of between 10 and 20% for not having disputed the objections and for having assumed commitments likely to prevent the implementation of such practices in the future. A surveying firm has also been fined The consultancy firm Coefficient is fined 158 400 € for having prepared, between 1998 and 2002, on behalf of the Lefèvre company and of its subsidiaries, price schedules intended for the preparation of false estimates and cover bids. Undertaking Amount of the fine (in euros) The Autorité de la concurrence points out that the victims of the cartels have the right to seek reparations Intended to punish violators of competition rules and to dissuade them from re-offending, in the interest of guaranteeing economic public order, fines are collected for the benefit of the Public treasury. However, public authorities and private persons who have been the cartel's victims, are entitled to seek reparation for the losses sustained in the competent courts Regional Directorate for cultural affairs. The participants of the cartel implemented in Haute-Normandie held almost all of the contracts in this region ; and the firms involved in the cartels set up in Basse-Normandie and in Picardie held more than 90 % of them.

The Autorité withdraws the decision authorizing the merger, thus requiring from the parties to renotify the transaction within one month. Moreover, Canal Plus Group is fined 30 million euros. > Version française    The Autorité de la concurrence has just issued a decision in which it establishes that Canal Plus Group did not fulfill several commitments – including key ones – that were attached to the decision authorizing in 2006 the acquisition of TPS and CanalSatellite by Vivendi Universal and Canal Plus Group. The Autorité de la concurrence  therefore withdraws the decision authorizing the merger . Unless they restore the previous situation (before the merger), Vivendi and Canal Plus Group will have to renotify the transaction to the Autorité within one month . The Autorité noted the seriousness of the breaches established – that are the result of some negligence and, generally speaking, of a repeated lack of diligence and ill will from Canal Plus – as well as the harm to competition that may be generated by these breaches to the commitments. Therefore, the Autorité imposed Canal Plus Group a financial penalty amounting 30 million euros .        THE MERGER BETWEEN CANAL PLUS AND TPS: A MAJOR TAKEOVER THAT REQUIRED MANY COMMITMENTS FROM THE CANAL PLUS GROUP The transaction, which led to the creation of the Canal+ France company, led to the merger of the two main operators on the pay-TV market, and in particular led to the creation of a monopoly in channel publishing and the distribution of premium pay-TV offerings and had the effect of strengthening Canal Plus Group's dominant position on the downstream market for the retail distribution of pay-TV . Due to the numerous risks of anticompetitive effects, the merger clearance decision issued by the Minister of the Economy after advice by the Conseil de la concurrence had been subject to the implementation of 59 commitments by Vivendi Universal and Canal Plus Group, aiming at addressing the competition concerns identified. The objective of this whole set of commitments was to grant pay-TV distributors that would still remain after the transaction (mainly internet access providers) the access to programmes/channels that are sufficiently attractive to enable them to constitute competitive pay-TV channels packages, which would help to make competition livelier on the downstream market of subscription based pay-TV. The commitments aimed to facilitate , on the upstream markets , the acquisition of broadcasting rights by Canal Plus Group competitors and to enable them , on the intermediate market of channel production , to purchase the rights to broadcast thematic channels, which prove necessary to constitute attractive pay-TV channels packages. The unbundling (i.e. a granted access to these channels for all distributors) of 7 TV channels (TPS Star, Cinéstar, Cinéculte, Cinétoile, Sport+, Piwi and Télétoon) was central in the set of commitments subscribed. This unbundling was linked with requirements covering the continuity of quality standards of the channels, and in particular of the premium character of TPS Star. The latter, which had “ a pivotal role in the development of competition on the downstream market ”, was supposed to take the lead in the pay-TV packages of Canal Plus Group competitors on the retail market. > For more details on the decision of 2006 and on the commitments subscribed, refer to File Nr 1 .  THE BREACHES OF COMMITMENTS ESTABLISHED        In total, the Autorité established that 10 commitments were breached.        Non-compliance with the commitments related to a granted access to channels and to the continuity of quality standards of these channels is deemed of particular seriousness by the Autorité , taking into account the essential character of these requirements to protect competition ( For more details, see below ). The Autorité also noted some other breaches regarding the relations between Canal Plus Group and independent TV channels as well as regarding the access to broadcasting rights. > For a comprehensive overview of all the breaches, refer to File Nr 2 . 1) Canal Plus Group was late in giving third party distributors access to the 7 TV channels it had to unbundle, the consequence of which was to give an advantage to its new offer “Le Nouveau CanalSat” Canal Plus Group did not give access to the 7 TV channels on schedule with the commitments  (breach to commitment Nr 56) . On 21 March 2007, Canal Plus launched on its platform a new offer named “ Le Nouveau CanalSat ”, prior to providing third party distributors access to the TV channels, and even prior to the communication of the technical specifications for having access to these channels, which were transmitted on 2 April 2007. This schedule slippage enabled Canal Plus to favor a customer migration from TPS's bouquet to “ Le Nouveau CanalSat ”, through a commercial proposal including “ new TV channels in the various thematic areas and exclusive content without price upgrade ”, when at the same time DSL internet service providers were not yet in the capacity to retail a package including whole or part of the 7 TV channels subject to the mandatory unbundling. These facts give evidence of discrimination to the detriment of DSL providers' platforms ( breach to commitment Nr 20 ) . 2) Canal Plus Group undermined the quality of the TV channels that were to be unbundled The obligation to maintain, in metropolitan France (commitments Nr 18 to 33) as well as in overseas départements (commitments Nr 34 and 35), quality standards of the unbundled TV channels, and in particular the premium character of TPS Star (commitment Nr 21), has to be interpreted in close conjunction with the unbundling obligation itself: the aim is to prevent the TV channels whose access is granted to third party distributors from being deprived of their attractive programmes. Declining quality of TPS Star and loss of its “premium” character Since 2007, a fast, significant and lasting deterioration of the quality of TPS Star has been noted, both in terms of programming and innovation . ( breach to commitment Nr 22, §1 – quality standards ) . This finding was established through objective, measurable and verifiable criteria. Among others, the Autorité observed a lasting and continuous drop in the costs of programming, a poorer movie programming, the loss of broadcasting rights for sports events, less attractive U.S. TV series broadcasted and the absence of technological innovation. This degradation led to a significant decrease of the channel's attractiveness towards TV viewers, as evidenced by a drop in audience ratings and a declining customer base. Moreover, a significant decrease of advertising expenditure of TPS Star demonstrates that Canal Plus Group did not go far in promoting this TV channel. ( For more details, see pages 16 to 28 ). Moreover, the Autorité established that Canal Plus Group did not meet the mandatory threshold levels regarding the programming of sports events. (breach to commitment Nr 20, §5) The sports events broadcasted were limited to football games played during the championship season and Canal Plus Group did not feed the channel with a number of “flagship games” that would have complied with the commitments. ( For more details, see pages 28 to 31 ). In the light of these facts taken as a whole, the Autorité considered that TPS Star could no longer be called a premium channel . ( breach to commitment Nr 21 ) Declining attractiveness of the movies channels Whereas the quantitative broadcasting requirements were complied with, the general obligations to maintain quality standards for the 3 movie channels TPS Cinéstar, TPS Cinétoile and TPSCinéCulte were not fulfilled. (breach to commitment Nr 22, §1). The modification of their status and positioning made them loose their attractiveness in terms of programming, the latter being mainly made up of old movies.        For example, in the case of TPS Cinéstar, which became CinéCinéma Star, before the transaction the channel focused on “ exclusive first transmissions ” of films. Since 31 March 2007, the channel does not broadcast any “ first transmissions ” nor “ exclusive first transmissions ”. Its programme schedule focuses exclusively on movies from the 1980's and 1990's, including French movies. It no longer broadcasts movies during Saturday prime time. Therefore, CinéCinéma Star does not have the same positioning and attractiveness as TPS Cinéstar had before the merger. ( For more details, see pages 32 to 34 ) Declining quality of the channels to which Parabole Réunion had access This decrease in quality was also noticed in the Réunion island, with respect to the activity of Parabole Réunion . TPS had granted Parabole Réunion exclusive distribution rights in the Indian ocean (including on the Réunion island) for various channels, including TPS Star, TPS Cinéstar and TPS Foot. Specific commitments were therefore imposed to guarantee that Canal Plus Group would renew the distribution contracts between TPS and Parabole Réunion and that the latter could continue to have access to attractive channels, under equivalent conditions to those in place before the merger. The attractiveness of TPS Star and TPS CinéStar (that became CinéCinéma Star) has clearly declined for the reasons explained above. As regards TPS Foot, the channel was deprived of its content (no more flagship game of major championship, no more live broadcasting, no more exclusive transmission). Parabole Réunion was not anymore in capacity to provide its customers with a pay-TV bouquet whose quality would be equivalent to the TPS bouquet as it was before the merger. As a consequence, Parabole Réunion lost many subscribers to the benefit of its direct competitor, Canal Plus Group. ( breach to commitment Nr 34 ) ( For more details, see pages 34 to 37 ) 3) Canal Plus Group did not comply with some of its commitments related to the relations with independent and third party TV channels A certain number of commitments had been subscribed by the new entity to enable third-party distributors to enrich their TV bouquets with attractive independent channels. The autonomy of these channels vis-à-vis Canal Plus Group and their viability had to be protected. The Autorité de la concurrence noted that Canal Plus Group kept several independent channel publishers (e.g. Equidia, Trace TV, Télémaison) in a situation of dependence, through relationships that remained opaque, non transparent and thus potentially discriminatory, in particular with regard to the determination of their fees (no services catalogue, no price list and remuneration scheme, no communication of criteria which could be used as a basis for a negotiation) and the duration of their contracts ( breach to commitment Nr 42 ) . Such a behaviour has contributed to reinforce the imbalance of the commercial negotiation – of which Canal Plus Group already took advantage –, to interfere with the smooth running of competition between the various distributors as well as between independent channels and channels controlled by minority shareholders of Canal+ France. In addition, Canal Plus Group committed to determine the fees to be paid to independent channels \" on terms and conditions that are comparable to those prevailing before the transaction \". Despite this, several channels were switched, after the transaction, from a model of variable remuneration to a model of fixed remuneration. ( breach to commitment Nr 41-b ) . Moreover, Canal Plus did not comply, in a number of cases, with the requirement to conclude separate contracts for the commercial distribution and for the transport, without making the first service conditional upon the other. ( breach to commitment Nr 44 ) ( For more details, see pages 40 to 47 )        CONCLUSION The Canal Plus-TPS merger was characterized by many and significant risks of anticompetitive effects. The number and content of the commitments subscribed by Canal Plus Group in 2006 highlighted the scope of the difficulties raised by the transaction. With regard to the essential character of some of the breaches established, Canal Plus Group cannot put forward, as a mitigating circumstance, the fact that the company complied with more than 80% of the commitments subscribed. Apart from the fact that this proportion is based on a questionable arithmetic formula (considering the 59 commitments on the same level, whereas their nature and scope varies significantly from one to another), it should be remembered that the clearance decision was issued in 2006 subject to the implementation of a whole set of 59 commitments, each remedy being required to prevent the risks to competition that had been identified. The Autorité de la concurrence therefore decided to withdraw the decision authorizing the transaction in 2006 and imposed Canal Plus Group a financial penalty amounting 30 million euros. Unless they restore the previous situation (before the merger), Vivendi and Canal Plus Group will have to notify again the transaction within one month. Décision du ministre de l'économie, des finances et de l'industrie du 30 août 2006, autorisant l'acquisition de TPS et CanalSatellite par Vivendi Universal et Groupe Canal Plus, after the opinion of the Conseil de la Concurrence was issued. At the date of the acquisition, mergers had to be submitted to the Minister of the Economy. From 2 March 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence has for its role to examine mergers. On 28 October 2009, The Autorité started proceedings ex officio regarding non compliance with commitments made binding by decision of the Minister. On the market of broadcasting rights acquisition (« upstream market »), the holders of rights to broadcast programmes (producers of cinematographic or audiovisual works, holders of sports rights, e.g. professional football league, …) meet the channel publishers, which role consist in aggregating audiovisual contents to constitute TV channels. On the pay-TV wholesale market (“intermediate market”), channel publishers (who purchased contents on the upstream market) sell the rights to broadcast the channels they have constituted to the distributors (“retailers”), so that the latter can offer these channels to customers, either individually or under a channels package (“bouquet”).

        "full_text_press_realease": "The text of decision No 11-D-17 initially published on the Autorité de la concurrence's website included a material error regarding the amount of the financial penalty imposed on Procter & Gamble (see the first page of decision No 11-D-17 of 8 December 2011 relative to practices implemented in the laundry detergent sector). The below press release was thus modified on 20 December 2011:       - the financial penalty on Procter & Gamble amounts to €240.24 million and not €233.56 million.       - the total amount of financial penalties is €367.9 million and not €361 million.        The Autorité de la concurrence fines a cartel between the four major laundry detergent manufacturers        a global amount of €367.9 million.       Unilever, who first disclosed the cartel, obtained full immunity from fines. > Version française The Autorité de la concurrence today issues a decision by which it fines a cartel between the four laundry detergent manufacturers active in France – Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Henkel and Colgate Palmolive – a total amount of €367.9 million. The companies coordinated their commercial strategies through a common determination of sale prices and promotions towards the French retail grocery sector (supermarkets and hypermarkets). All product categories of the major laundry detergent brands which are available in France, like Ariel, Skip, Le Chat, Dash, Omo, Super Croix, Gama, Persil and X Tra , fell within the scope of the cartel agreement, which lasted between 1997 and 2004 – with an interruption between October 1998 and November 1999. All the product formats (powder, liquid and tablets) were included in the agreement. Today's decision concerns the most important leniency case investigated until now by the Autorité . Moreover, it is the first time, in France, that a leniency case concerns a mass-market product . It has also to be noted that all the parties involved in the cartel decided to cooperate with the Autorité , in the framework of the French leniency programme. In 2008, Unilever disclosed the existence of the cartel to the Autorité de la concurrence Following a legal audit which was conducted within his company in 2006, a Unilever employee disclosed to the legal department a document of 283 pages – that he was keeping at home –, which stated an anticompetitive agreement between the four detergent manufacturers (Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Henkel and Colgate-Palmolive), covering prices and promotions. In March 2008, Unilever – which had been inspected under an investigation on anticompetitive practices regarding other products – submitted a leniency application to the Autorité de la concurrence . The leniency procedure allows, under certain conditions, to grant full or partial exemption from fines – depending, in particular, if its order of arrival – to a company that disclosed the existence of an anticompetitive agreement in which it took part. Thereafter, between 2008 and 2009, the three other major laundry detergent manufacturers (Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive) successively submitted to the Autorité their own leniency applications ( see File N°1 : the leniency programme ). Between 1997 and 2004, and several times a year, the four manufacturers held secret talks on their pricing and promotion policies, which took place in hotels and restaurants Commercial directors of the French subsidiaries met together three or four times a years to agree on the prices and promotions that they would subsequently offer, individually, to hypermarkets and supermarkets. These talks, during which price schedules were exchanged, took place in Parisian hotels and in restaurants of the West Paris area (Marne-la-Coquette and Louveciennes). On some charts, the Autorité noted that cartel participants typed a code name: “ Hugues ” for Henkel, “ Pierre ” for Procter & Gamble, “ Laurence ” or “ Louis ” for Lever (Unilever) and “ Christian ” for Colgate. These meetings were kept secret and some participants called them “ store checks ”. When negotiations were stalling or when the agreed rules were not observed, CEOs and managing directors of the French subsidiaries of these groups might have to intervene during a meeting. A large-scale and widespread anticompetitive agreement At regular intervals, the prices for each reference, brand and product format (powder, tablets and liquid) were determined between the four manufacturers. The aim was to stifle competition and to “ stabilize the market ”, by avoiding any “ price war ” on the French market. The agreement on prices Talks between cartel members first focused on the price differences that had to be maintained between the different brands, within each segment (high-end, mid-range and low-end). Then, all price increases planned by detergent manufacturers on the French market were the subject of a common negotiation, in order to preserve the positioning of the different brands ( for more details, refer to §151 et seq. of the decision ). Table: price differences agreed between detergent brands Unilever Henkel Procter & Gamble Colgate Palmolive Pricing agreement implemented Regular detergents High-end products Skip Le Chat Ariel             Mr Propre*              Vizir Ariel vs Skip le Chat Mid-range products Omo Super Croix Dash [Axion until 2003]** Dash vs Omo, Super Croix Axion Low-end products Persil X Tra Gama             Bonux [Gama until 2003]** *The laundry detergent Mr Propre brand had been launched end of 2004 and was terminated in 2006.       **End of 2003, Colgate Palmolive transferred its assets in laundry detergents in France to Procter & Gamble The agreement on promotions Cartel members also coordinated their promotion policies on the French market. “Promotion rules” were putting limits on the promotions that cartel members could offer: format, schedule, amount, number per year, advertising, etc. Many parameters were jointly determined in this way, product by product. E.g. in 2003, the extras consisting of a free product were “ prohibited ” by the agreement, thus impeding in practice any kind of “two-for-one” special offer. Similarly, promotional discounts were capped at a level depending on the size of the product: 15% for a 45 doses package, 18% for a 54 doses package and 20% for package of more than 54 doses ( for more details, refer to §205 et seq. of the decision ). The monitoring of compliance with the cartel rules In order to secure the full observance of the cartel rules, every manufacturer watched the promotional leaflets disseminated by supermarkets and hypermarkets or asked his sales teams to provide a price reporting. The aim was to check if prices displayed in shops and promotions were in line with the cartel decisions. By taking advantage of the Galland Law, such practices had a direct impact on retail prices paid by consumers Laundry detergents represent a significant part of households' spending and grocery retailers use them to attract consumers' attention. The widespread collusion on the laundry detergent sector enabled manufacturers to restrict competition in this sector in France during almost 6 years , by maintaining prices paid by consumers at higher levels than those that would have resulted from an undistorted competition. On the downstream market, the Galland Law favoured aligned price levels in supermarkets and hypermarkets. Indeed, this law forbad retailers to sell products at a price below the purchase price, eventually taking into account the invoice rebates offered by their suppliers. By paying the retailers exclusively through hidden margins (“ marges arrières ”), suppliers took profit of this loss-leader threshold to settle a floor price system and to control retail prices ( for more details, refer to File No2 ). The Autorité imposed financial penalties for a total amount of €367.9 million To set the level of financial penalties, the Autorité de la concurrence implemented the legal criteria (seriousness of the facts, importance of the harm done to the economy, situation of the sanctioned undertaking or of the group to which it belongs). In this case, it took into account the particular seriousness of the practices as well as the various aspects of the harm that these practices have done to the economy. This harm is undoubted, even if mitigated by some elements that are noted in the Autorité 's decision. The amount of the financial penalties also takes into consideration the fact that the concerned companies or groups operate worldwide, have diversified business areas and dispose of significant resources. The Autorité detailed, at each step, the method that was followed to calculate the financial penalties, in accordance with the Notice on the Method Relating to the Setting of Financial Penalties that it published on 16 May 2011 ( link to the full document, in its English version ) and which was implemented in this case, for the first time. At the end of his assessment, the Autorité granted exemptions or reductions in fines, in accordance with the French Leniency Programme ( for more details, refer to File N° 1 on the leniency procedure ). For being the first company to apply for leniency, Unilever was not fined. Having fulfilled the conditions required to benefit from leniency, Unilever was exempted from a €248.5 million fine. Based on the added value of the pieces of evidence that they had provided – which itself depends on the order of arrival when submitting their leniency applications – and on the cooperation that they demonstrated during the whole inspection and investigation phases, the other companies (Henkel, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive) have respectively benefited from a 25%, 20% and 15% reduction of fine. The final amounts of financial penalties are:       Unilever: 0       Henkel: €92.3 million       Procter & Gamble: €240.24 million       Colgate Palmolive: €35.4 million 1- The four previous leniency cases investigated by the Autorité concerned intermediary markets or relatively specific goods: steel products trading ( 08-D-32 ), production of plywood ( 08-D-12 ), national and international removal services ( 07-D-48 ), door manufacturing ( 06-D-09 ).       2- Following a new commercial policy decided by Proter & Gamble, the cartel was temporarily interrupted between October 1998 and November 1999.

Given Kontiki's exclusive rights to distribute Diddl products in France, all Diddl goods for children sold in France between 2003 and early 2007 were affected. The Autorité today imposes a financial penalty of €1.34 million on the French distributor of these products. The Diddl character: a real fashion phenomenon for children Created in Germany in the 1990s, the character Diddl is a mouse with giant paws. Initially featured on a postcard, the character then appeared on a wide range of products. The mouse generated true “Diddl-mania” in children from the mid-2000s which died down after 2007. Pursuing a scarcity strategy, Kontiki, the exclusive distributor of Diddl products in France, established a selective distribution network restricted to just 1,700 sales points. Such practices eliminated any price competition among distributors Between 2003 and 2007, Kontiki required its dealers, whether independent or members of a network (La Papethèque, Cadoon's, Virgin, Soho, etc.), to sign “ charters ” or agreements specifically rendering their listing on the website Diddl.fr dependent on their compliance with the retail prices notified in price lists, order forms or through pre-labelling of the products supplied. The retail prices, described as “recommended prices”, were in reality imposed: “ these are not minimum or maximum prices but the prices with which we must comply ”; “ we cannot sell below these prices”, as testified by various retailers. Others referred to warnings or pressure when they charged retail prices below the asserted “recommended prices ”. The Autorité has imposed a financial penalty of €1.34 million Euros The prices imposed by Kontiki had serious repercussions insofar as for more than five years, they restricted price competition among dealers to the detriment of consumers, whereas there was a high demand for Diddl products from children. Nevertheless the Autorité de la concurrence took account of Kontiki's highly specific individual situation given that its turnover is now significantly less than at the time of the events. It imposed a financial penalty of €1.34 million Euros. > Link to the full text of decision 11-D-19 of 15 December 2011 on practices implemented in the fancy goods and toys distribution sector > Press contact: André Piérard / Tel: +33 (0)1 55 04 02 28 / Contact by email  > See Judgement of the Paris Court of Appeal (16th May 2013) > See Judgement of the Court of Cassation/Supreme Court of Appeal (7th October 2014)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence makes commitments proposed by Carrefour concerning a Parisian supermarket franchised under the Champion name binding Carrefour commits to adapt the standard Carrefour Market franchise agreement with regards this supermarket > Version française   Following a complaint filed in August 2010 by the companies Marcadet Distribution 75 and Marcadet Exploitation 75 (which operate a supermarket under the brand name Champion in the 18th arrondissement of Paris) regarding practices implemented by Carrefour SA , the Autorité de la concurrence today issues a decision whereby it accepts and renders mandatory commitments made by Carrefour towards the complainant companies.  In this same case, the Autorité de la concurrence had already issued a decision on 23 February 2011 (No. 11-D-04 ), by which it rejected the complainant companies' request for conservative measures for lack of urgency, but decided to continue the investigation on the merits of the case, considering that the practices examined were liable to constitute anticompetitive practices. Competition concerns As the Autorité had indicated to Carrefour in July 2011, in its preliminary assessment, the possible replacement of the Champion franchise agreement of the Marcadet shop by a Carrefour Market franchise agreement under more restrictive conditions (notably concerning an increase in the membership term from 3 to 7 years, the introduction of a non-renewal of membership and post-contractual non-competition clause, of a post-contractual right of priority on the business in favour of Carrefour and a deferred initial franchise fee) was in fact liable to represent an abuse of economic dependence. The commitments proposed by Carrefour are made binding by the Autorité In order to address competition concerns raised by the Autorité, Carrefour submitted to it, on 29 July 2011, commitments proposals . In the decision issued today, the Autorité makes these commitments mandatory, by which Carrefour commits to offer complainant companies the signing of a new franchise agreement under the brand name Carrefour Market, of which some clauses have been relaxed in relation to the standard Carrefour Market agreement initially put forward to complainant companies and this to prevent the replacement of the brand name Champion by the brand name Carrefour Market being an opportunity to introduce more restrictive clauses into the agreement than those provided for in the Champion franchise agreement. Carrefour will have to send a new Carrefour Market franchise agreement proposal to complainant companies within one month, in which notably: - the initial agreement term will be reduced to 3 years (renewable by 3 year periods), instead of the 7 years renewable by periods of 7 years initially suggested; - any post-contractual non-renewal of membership and non-competition clause will be deleted; - the right of priority will be organised, to ensure it is only exercised during the agreement term; - the deferred initial franchise fee will be deleted. The commitments made by Carrefour are in line with the analysis carried out by the Autorité in its Opinion No. 10-A-26 of 7 December 2010 relating to affiliation agreements of independent retailers and the terms for acquiring commercial land in the food retail sector, in which it had denounced the restrictive clauses encompassing commercial relations between food retail groups and their affiliated shops. It had notably pointed out, in its opinion, the excessive duration and the overlapping of agreements and the multiplicity of post-contractual restrictive clauses. market test > Full text of Decision No. 11-D-20 of 16 December 2011 relating to practices implemented by Carrefour in the food retail sector > Press contact: André Piérard - Tel. +33 (0)1 55 04 02 28   > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (24th January 2013)",

The leisure, culture and tourism engineering sector The consulting firms bring their expertise to local and regional authorities, tourist information centres or businesses tasked with promoting and enhancing tourist, cultural or leisure facilities such as places of accommodation and catering, museums, châteaux, religious buildings, marinas or amusement parks. A \"fair price\" had to be charged by consulting firms that are members of the trade association Between 2002 and 2010, the Syndicat national de l'ingénierie des loisirs, de la culture et du tourisme ( Géfil - national trade association of leisure, culture and tourism engineering) and several consulting firms drew up a sheet entitled \"Fair pricing” listing fees deemed \"reasonable\" or \"decent\" and circulated it to the profession. This sheet, which was used as a benchmark for price quotations filed by consulting firms in response to calls for tenders, aimed to avoid \"dumping\" and a \"price war\" between firms and thereby \"drive up the sector's prices\". Price checks guaranteeing compliance with the anticompetitive agreement by the participants The pricing instructions were accompanied by measures aimed at ensuring the observance of the set prices. Price checks were organized by Géfil to ascertain that the prices charged matched those set jointly. The local authorities issuing invitations to tender were alerted when certain quotations were deemed \"abnormally low\" by the trade association. The financial penalties Through their participation in this anticompetitive agreement, Géfil departed from its remit of defending its members and distorted the competitive procurement procedures initiated by their sponsors. The Autorité de la concurrence has also sanctioned certain consulting firms that participated directly in the anticompetitive agreement in their capacity as Géfil Board members. The financial penalties reflect the participants' individual involvement in the anticompetitive agreement, the length thereof and their ability to pay. In view of Géfil's limited resources, the Autorité has imposed a symbolic penalty on it.

It also fines French millers for two anticompetitive agreements on a national scale a total of € 146.9 million. > Version française   The Autorité de la concurrence today issues a decision whereby it fines different anticompetitive agreements in the packaged flour sector a total of € 242.4 million. On the one hand, a cartel of German and French millers was aimed at limiting imports of flour between France and Germany, and on the other, two anticompetitive agreements of French millers were aimed at fixing prices, limiting output and sharing out the customer base for packaged flour marketed to French supermarkets and hypermarkets on the one hand and to hard-discount retailers on the other. An application for leniency from a German miller gave rise to the case In April 2008, following an application for leniency submitted by a German miller (Wilh. Werhahn GmbH & Co. KG and its subsidiaries), the erstwhile Conseil de la concurrence (transformed into the Autorité de la concurrence in March 2009) opened an ex officio investigation into the flour milling sector. The leniency procedure enables a company which hands over inside evidence of anticompetitive practices it may have been party to, to be granted, under certain conditions, full or partial immunity from fines, depending in particular on the order of arrival of its application. Unannounced inspections conducted in France and in Germany (through the German competition authority, the Budeskartellamt) gathered many pieces of evidence of these anticompetitive agreements. These raids were followed by an in-depth investigation. In January 2010, the Autorité decided to conduct a separate investigation into practices implemented in the craft bakery sector. These practices are currently being investigated and will be the subject of another decision in due course. The cartel agreement among German and French millers: a ‘non-compete agreement' The evidence ascertained that French and German millers concluded a ‘non-compete agreement' aimed at limiting their respective access to each other's markets and at maintaining French and German exports of packaged flour at a predetermined level (15,000 tons). They met several times (at twelve meetings) to work out the details of their agreement. Moreover, on a case–by-case basis, they allocated certain customers based in France to each other, and agreed on principles for smoothing the prices of packaged flour imported from Germany in order to meet the agreed quota. Infringements of competition law have been proven over a 6-year period (from 2002 to 2008). The following financial penalties have been imposed on cartel members: Total 95 537 000 € (*) French company (**) German company Werhahn – 2nd largest milling group in Germany – has been granted full immunity from fines under the leniency programme. It was liable for a fine of €16.66 million. France Farine and Bach Mühle played a leading role in the cartel: their fines have been increased by 10%. On the contrary, Bindewald, which had a ‘maverick' conduct, benefited from a 10% reduction in the fine. A cartel is one the most serious infringements of competition law, as it deprives consumers of the benefits of a robust marketplace. Flour is a commodity used in the preparation of many home-prepared dishes, which makes it an indispensable consumer product. The harm the cartel has caused to consumers is all the greater because of the relatively low price elasticity of the demand for packaged flour, due to the absence of a substitute product. This cartel had a number of consequences: It led to a market fragmentation between two EU Member States (France and Germany) of a significant dimension , thereby directly impeding the interpenetration of economies which the Treaty of the European Union seeks to bring about.    It protected French millers from the competition of their German counterparts and prevented the latter from stimulating competition on the French market. It thus supported the anticompetitive agreement that French millers implemented in France through the France Farine and Bach Mühle (see below) joint-venture companies. In the food retail and hard-discount sectors, French millers were able to keep prices above the competitive level and to share the market, while German millers refrained from bidding in calls for tenders, including, from the end of the 90s, tenders organized in the hard-discount sector (Aldi, Lidl…). As a consequence, French consumers end up paying more. The French millers' anticompetitive agreement, supported by the joint-venture companies France Farine and Bach Mülhe, foreclosed the French market The majority of French millers have opted to group together in two joint-ventures that market their output on their behalf and as an agent: France Farine , formed in 1965, markets packaged flour to food retailers , mainly under the “Francine” national brand, on behalf of all miller-shareholders. France Farine developed the brand and owns it. (for further details, please refer to file 1 of the press kit - in French)  Similarly, Bach Mülhe , formed in 1971, markets flour to hard-discount operators (e.g. Aldi, Lidl), which jointly organize annual calls for tenders on a national scale. (for further details, please refer to file 1 of the press kit - in French) (“entreprises communes”) France Farine was the support of a genuine centralized organization of the flour market, eliminating any competition among millers, in particular on the Francine brand. France Farine marketed the packaged flour produced by its shareholder-members to food retailers, applying a single selling price that had been previously jointly set: a single price for products sold under the Francine brand name, and a single price for products sold under private labels or under “low price” brands.  Once the commercial negotiation with its food retailer customers was concluded, France Farine allocated customer orders on the basis of a fixed allocation key: France Farine sent each order to the miller “closest to the ordering customer site”. In the end, this allocation key based on the geographic location of each constituent's bagging facilities resulted in the allocation, for each of them, of a pre-assigned geographic area. In the same way, the Autorité de la concurrence considered that Bach Mülhe's methods of operation enabled its shareholder-millers to offer a single selling price for packaged flour sold to hard-discounters, to apply a uniform commercial policy and to share out customers and outputs among themselves. Seven millers have been fined a total of €146.9 million:  Total 146 885 000 € The Autorité has considered that the seriousness of this anticompetitive agreement, which enabled the French millers to manipulate the main competition parameters (prices, brands; allocation of customers, markets and outputs), caused significant harm to French consumers, in particular due to its very long duration. Added to the other aspects of the sanctioned practices, in particular the crowding-out of German imports on the French market, it resulted in the whole market being foreclosed : to maintain the high prices achieved through France Farine for packaged flour sold to food retailers, the companies involved implemented a similar mechanism regarding hard-discount retailers through their joint-venture Bach Mühle. The whole market was then under control, from the hard-discount segment to the food retailing sector, and all market segments of the packaged flour sector were concerned (national brands and private labels, low price brands and hard-discount). In accordance with the Notice on the setting of financial penalties issued on 16 May 2011, the Autorité took account of the financial difficulties of Grands Moulins de Strasbourg and reduced its fine to take account of its ability to pay. There are other ongoing proceedings regarding the milling sector in Europe: in Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium.  > Full text of Decision 12-D-09 of 13 March 2012 > Press contact: André Piérard - Tel: (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 - email This press release translated into English is for information purposes only.

The dry dog and cat food market  France has approximately 8 million dogs and 10 million cats. The three manufacturers fined covered, at the time of the facts, more than 70% of overall sales of dry dog and cat food in specialist retail. The sale of dry food (also called \"kibbles\") represents nearly 70% of overall sales of cat and dog food in France. In dry food, a distinction is made between standard products, which are distributed mainly in food supermarkets, and top of the range foods (also called premium and super premium), which are sold exclusively in specialist retail. With regard to specialist retail, Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Royal Canin sell their top of the range products to independent wholesalers, which then sell these products to retail outlets of specialist stores: BHV, Delbard, Gamm Vert, Jardiland, Leroy Merlin, Monsieur Bricolage, Truffaut, etc. Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Royal Canin, which have not challenged the facts, implemented concerted practices with all their independent wholesalers to restrict competition For 5 years, from 2004 to 2008, Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Royal Canin implemented concerted practices with all their independent wholesalers. The two suppliers each implemented a range of practices tending to restrict competition: imposition of resale price on their wholesalers; prohibition of \"passive sales\"; territorial, supply and clientele exclusivities. Owing to these practices (expanded on below), retailers were unable to rely on competition between wholesalers to reduce their supply costs. All these competition restraints were of a kind that generate additional costs and therefore repercussions on the prices charged to end consumers of the Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Royal Canin brands. • Resale prices imposed by the manufacturers  The resale prices of products for specialist purchase centres or brand name purchasing bodies were negotiated directly between the manufacturers and these centres even though the latter purchased their products from wholesalers who got their supplies from the aforementioned manufacturers. On the strength of this system, the wholesalers were therefore not free to set their prices: the rate negotiated nationally for shops of the same retail chain was applied in the same way by all wholesalers. With regard to Nestlé Purina Petcare France, these imposed price practices extended to independent shops not belonging to a particular retail chain. • Territorial restraints Each wholesaler operated over a limited geographical area only, determined by the manufacturer. This territorial exclusivity contributed to wholesale market partitioning and weakening competition between wholesalers for products of the same brand (\"intra-brand\" competition).  Furthermore, wholesalers refused to sell products to a retail outlet situated outside their distribution area (\"passive sales\"). A given shop could therefore only get its supplies from a single wholesaler assigned to it by the manufacturer. Consequently, wholesalers actually did not compete with one another. • Accumulation of exclusivity clauses Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Royal Canin set up distinct and impenetrable distribution systems for their top of the range products linked to the retailer category concerned. Wholesale sales to specialist shops and breeders were entrusted to a network of independent wholesalers, while products intended for vets (and supermarkets, concerning Nestlé Purina Petcare France) were distributed directly by the manufacturers.  This client exclusivity, which helped to partition the markets concerned for some product ranges, thus limited competition preventing retailers from relying on competition between wholesalers. Furthermore, wholesalers had no option but to accept an exclusive purchasing agreement from a single manufacturer (\"single brand\" distribution) preventing a retailer from choosing between several brands when it purchased at a defined wholesaler. This sales strategy among manufacturers relied on an incentive system of discounts granted to wholesalers, the effect of which was reinforced by the multiplicity of references and the saturation of their logistical capabilities. Hill's Pet Nutrition forbade exports of its products outside France Hill's Pet Nutrition (Colgate Palmolive group), which used five wholesalers-vets for the resale of its product ranges aimed at vets, made agreements with its wholesalers-vets over 5 years, from 2004 to 2008, to ban exports of its products outside France. A clause, mentioned in the general terms of sale concluded by Hill's with wholesalers-vets, concerned a ban on delivering products to vets situated outside France without the manufacturer's prior agreement. Financial penalties imposed The Autorité assessed the overall seriousness of the practices and the extent of the damage to the economy.  The various concerted practices implemented concerned products \"that elicit an emotional investment for end consumers, who are vulnerable to brand loyalty \". Furthermore, price elasticity of demand for these products is low, in view of consumer loyalty to brands.  The Autorité states in its decision that the damage to the economy is potentially all the greater as price elasticity of demand is low. In fact, while competition should theoretically lead to prices closer to costs – and this all the more so as it is strong -, anticompetitive concerted practices allow companies implementing them to increase their prices even more sharply as demand is price inelastic.  Concerning the practice of territorial exclusivity implemented by Hill's Pet Nutrition and its wholesalers-vets, the Autorité observed that the damage to the economy had been extremely limited, or even nonexistent, considering the fact that the contractual clause had been limited to the vet sector only and was not in fact applied. To determine the level of the financial penalties, the Autorité also took into account the individual situation of each company, notably the respective duration of practices implemented by each of them, and the global reach and financial resources of the Nestlé, Mars and Colgate Palmolive groups, to which Nestlé Purina Petcare France, Royal Canin and Hill's belong respectively. It also took into account the reiteration of practices by Royal Canin, owing to a previous breach of competition rules (decision of the Conseil de la concurrence of 22 June 2005 ). However, the Autorité granted penalty reductions of 18% to Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Nestlé SA and 20% to Royal Canin and Mars Incorporated for having waived their right to challenge the charges (settlement procedure) and having made commitments concerning their competition law compliance programmes in particular. The final amount of financial penalties stands at: Companies Penalty amount Nestlé Purina Petcare France and Nestlé SA Group €19,040,000 Royal Canin SAS and Mars Incorporated Group €11,618,000 Hill's Pet Nutrition SNC and Colgate Palmolive Company Group €4,664,000 05-D-32 > Full text of decision 12-D-10 of 20 March 2012 on practices implemented in the cat and dog food sector > Press contact: André Piérard - Tel.: +33 (0)1 55 04 02 28 This press release translated into English is for information purposes only.

The commitments the Bigard Group made in 2009 A decision on 17 February 2009 authorised the Bigard Group to take sole control of Socopa Viandes. In order to avoid excessive concentration in the meat processing industry, the Ministry of the Economy  made the deal subject to seven conditions, including the sale of five slaughterhouses or processing plants, prohibition of \"range\" discounts and the signing of a brand licensing agreement for the beef brand Valtéro, which until then belonged to Socopa. The purpose of this commitment was to counterbalance the excessively strong position the transaction gave the Bigard Group — a [65-70]% market share on the retail marinated meat market — and, consequently, to ensure that its brands (Bigard and Charal) still had competition. The Bigard Group has implemented various practices that have stripped the commitment it made to sign a brand-licensing agreement of all substance. The Bigard Group had an obligation to sign a brand-licensing agreement for the Valtéro brand so that a competitor could operate the latter, which is very well known to consumers. But through various practices, the Bigard Group removed all substance from the agreement. Between late 2009 and early 2010 the Bigard Group affixed stickers to trays of Valtéro meat and Valtero product packaging telling consumers that the brand was becoming Socopa. The Bigard Group also featured the same visual identity as Valtéro products' packaging (the heart graphic charter, visual and gen code) on the entire Socopa line. Moreover, the Bigard Group rolled out print media and poster advertising campaigns informing the public of the change of Valtéro's name. These practices effectively transferred the Valtero brand name recognition to Socopa, discouraging candidates likely to be interested in the brand licence. Circumventing a commitment is a serious practice The Bigard Group has stripped an important commitment of the authorisation decision, whose purpose was to drive competition on the meat-processing market and in supermarkets, of its substance. The other effect of these actions was to prevent the signing of the licensing agreement in good conditions, the initially interested party having decided not to finalise it . This behaviour is all the more egregious as it was implemented on a large scale, by an operator particularly experienced in the meat industry, and only gradually ceased despite repeated warnings from the official responsible for monitoring fulfilment of the commitments. The Autorité, consequently, has fined Bigard Group one million euros. On 2 March 2009 the power of monitoring mergers was transferred from the Ministry of the Economy to the Autorité de la concurrence, which is also responsible for monitoring undertakings made by the parties to the operations. Bigard Group had trouble finding a company to take over the license, so it eventually sold the brand. In May 2011 the Autorité de la concurrence authorised the Établissements Montfort to take over the brand.  > Read the entire text of decision 12-D-15 of 9 July 2012 on compliance with commitments in the decision authorising Bigard Group's takeover of Socopa Viandes .  > Press contact: André Piérard – Tel.: (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 / Contact by email",

The main interbank fees will be halved with effect from 1 September 2012 and completely abolished on 1 September 2013. In this way, fees amounting to almost €300 million a year will be re-injected into the economy. > Version française  At the end of a negotiated procedure with the French banks that are party to the procedure ( Banque de France, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit du Nord, Crédit Agricole, LCL, BPCE – Banques Populaires Caisses d'Epargne, HSBC, Banque Postale, Crédit Mutuel and CIC ) and their representative bodies ( Association française des banques – AFB and Fédération bancaire française – FBF), the Autorité de la concurrence has published a decision under which it renders mandatory the commitment given by the banks to abolish with effect from 1 September 2013 the main interbank fees concerned by the procedure. In a first phase, all these fees will be halved with effect from 1 September 2012 . This is part of an in-depth examination of all means of payment: after dealing with ‘cheques' and ‘bank cards', the Autorité has examined the issue of interbank fees on direct debits, interbank payment orders and other non-cash means of payment Following a referral by two associations, the Fédération des entreprises du commerce et de la distribution (FCD) and the Association pour la défense des utilisateurs des moyens de paiement européens (ADUMPE), the Autorité de la concurrence investigated compliance with the competition rules for interbank fees related to the use of non-cash means of payment other than payment cards and cheques – direct debits, transfers, interbank payment orders (titres interbancaires de paiement, TIP), online payments (télérèglements) and electronic bills of exchange (lettres de change relevé, LCR) . These means of payment are among the most widely used in France ( see Document 3 in the press kit ). Cheques and CB payment cards have already been the subject of decisions of the Autorité, respectively in September 2010 (fining decision) and July 2011 (commitments decision). A separate procedure is under way in respect of non-CB payment cards ( see Document 1 in the press kit ). A speedy procedure and commitments made binding by the decision issued by the Autorité The Autorité first notified the banks of its competition concerns: the interbank fees set by the main banks could be considered to restrict competition in that the banks jointly agreed, since the end of the 1960s in some cases, on set amounts for interbank fees that added to the cost for the paying banks and could therefore push up the prices charged to the banks' customers. During the investigation, the banks requested the benefit of a commitments procedure which would enable them, on a voluntary and negotiated basis, to draw up proposals responding to the Autorité's competition concerns. The initial commitments proposed by the banks were submitted to a market test ( see Press release of 10 April 2012 ), in the framework of which the Autorité received 19 contributions from concerned parties (the initiating associations, billing companies, merchants, a consumer association). The Autorité obtained significant improvements on the banks' initial commitments, bringing them more closely into line with the contributors' expectations. The Autorité's decision renders mandatory the final commitments proposed by the banks, bringing to an end the legal proceedings taken against them and paving the way for rapidly restoring competition. Commitments given by the banks and rendered mandatory by the Autorité: the abolition of most fees as from 1 September 2013, following on the halving of all fees as from 1 September 2012. All interbank fees will be revised downwards and the main fees will be removed. The main fees will therefore be halved with effect from 1 September 2012 before disappearing totally on 1 September 2013:  Exceptional fees on rejections will also be reduced by 50% before being reassessed on the basis of a study of the costs incurred by the banks, based on specifications approved by the Autorité de la concurrence. Firstly, these fees will from now on remunerate optional services requested by the creditor – information made available or transmitted (between banks) relating to the rejection and its cause – and will no longer be charged automatically. Secondly, the banks have undertaken to precisely redefine the cost elements covered by the fees , under the Autorité's supervision. The Autorité will also assess the final study's compliance with the specifications. If the costs study is not approved by the Autorité, the fees will be suspended with effect from 1 September 2013 until a fully compliant study is completed.  The Autorité also renders mandatory the commitment made by Fédération bancaire française (FBF) – which includes the members of Association bancaire française, AFB – to distribute to its members – all banks active in France – the commitments subscribed by the banks party to the procedure. Repercussions for bank customers During the investigation, it was found that banks, when they act as creditors' banks , bill creditor customers for each receipt of payment (by direct debit, interbank payment order or online payment), often at a higher rate than the interbank fee. As interbank fees are passed on to the creditors (the billing companies that are paid by customers using direct debits or interbank payment orders – such as energy suppliers, telephone/Internet companies and insurers), their removal will generate substantial savings for the billing companies (bank customers). The amount of fees that will thus be re-injected into the economy is close to €300 million per year ( see Document 3 in the press kit ) Indirectly, consumers are likely to benefit from this change as the savings in terms of bank charges for the creditors will be passed on to them, e.g. in their prices. The FCD represents companies in the food trade and those that supply them. The electronic bill of exchange corresponds to the paperless form of the traditional bill of exchange. See decision 10-D-28 and the press release of 20 September 2010 . This decision was reversed by the Paris Court of Appeal, and an appeal to the Court of Cassation is pending. See decision 11-D-11 and the press release of 7 July 2011 . These cards represent less than 5% of payment cards in France.  > View the full text of Decision 12-D-17 of 5 July 2012 relating to practices observed in the sector of non-cash means of payment (direct debits, interbank payment orders, online payments, transfers and bills of exchange) > Full text of commitments of French banks and the Fédération bancaire française (FBF) > View press kit: - Document 1: Interbank-fees: a far-reaching issue for Autorité de la concurrence (in French) - Document 2: France's position compared with its European neighbours (in French) - Document 3: Some data relating to interbank fees on direct debits and interbank payment orders (in French) - Document 4: How interbank fees work (in French)  > Press contact: André Piérard – Tel.: (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 / Contact by email",

        "full_text_press_realease": "France Télécom may ask to be remunerated for opening additional capacity but it must clarify the commercial and billing relationship between its Internet access and Internet transit businesses. The transparency commitments made by France Télécom to the Autorité de la concurrence will facilitate the prevention and monitoring of potential margin squeezes in the future. > Version française  first  Internet neutrality  In this case, the US telecommunications operator Cogent claimed, among other things, that France Télécom was compromising the peering system (enabling exchange of traffic flows between networks, free of charge) used by transit operators, by requesting payment for opening up additional technical capacity for access to Orange subscribers. Regarding this claim, the Autorité considered that in view of the highly asymmetric nature of the traffic exchanged between France Télécom and Cogent, such a payment request does not in itself constitute an anti-competitive practice inasmuch as this type of remuneration is not uncommon in the Internet industry in cases where a significant imbalance exists between the incoming and outgoing flows exchanged between two networks, and is consistent with the overall peering policy adopted by France Télécom, with which Cogent is familiar. However, the Autorité also noted a certain lack of transparency in the relationship between the domestic network of France Télécom (Orange) and its transit operator business (Open Transit), creating a potential for margin squeezes. France Télécom agreed to make commitments to prevent such situations and enable appropriate monitoring. The Internet interconnection market Three types of stakeholder operate in the Internet interconnection market:  - Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Orange, Free, SFR and Bouygues Télécom, which provide internet access services to consumers; - Content and service providers (Google, Amazon, websites more generally, hosting services, etc.); - Transit operators , such as Cogent, Tata Telecom or France Télécom (via its Open Transit brand), which interconnect ISPs with each other and with content providers via their international networks. The following block diagram illustrates the relationship between Internet players (the arrows represent data exchange flows):  Operators interconnect with each other using either the \"peering\" or the \"transit\" method (with larger operators making use of both solutions). In the most common cases, ISPs and websites purchase transit services from one or more transit operators in order to connect to the Internet and deliver traffic flows to internet users. Internet operators are also able to connect with each other without a transit operator, via \"peering\" agreements whereby each \"peer\" operator exchanges data flows free of charge - in a balanced exchange - with another peer to provide access to its customers.   The request submitted by France Télécom to charge a fee for opening additional interconnection capacity does not appear unfair inasmuch as it is consistent with its peering policy Peering-based data exchanges, although generally free of charge, are sometimes charged for, hence the term \"paid peering\", if the traffic exchanged between transit operators is asymmetric. The peering policy operated by France Télécom (and indeed most transit operators) specifies a maximum traffic ratio (i.e. the ratio between the traffic volumes entering the Orange network and the outgoing traffic volumes sent to the transit operator's network), above which a fee may be charged. The purpose of this policy is to prevent congestion of the Orange network. France Télécom states in its peering policy that it would charge for opening additional capacity if the incoming traffic entering its network exceeded the outgoing traffic by a factor of more than 2.5. This ratio was specified in the agreement between Cogent and France Télécom concluded in 2005. At that time, the MegaUpload website – since then shut down by US legal authorities – was a Cogent customer that used to send Orange subscribers, via Cogent, very significant traffic volumes (up to 13 times greater than in the other direction), essentially video content downloaded by web users. In view of the severely dissymmetric traffic to its detriment, exceeding the maximum ratio stated in its peering policy, France Télécom wished to charge for opening additional interconnection capacity . The Autorité de la concurrence considers that such a practice was not liable to contravene competition law inasmuch as France Télécom did not refuse access to its subscribers by Cogent – and indeed opened additional capacity free of charge on several occasions between 2005 and 2011, in response to demand from Cogent – but simply requested payment for opening new capacity, in accordance with its peering policy , without seeking to charge for existing capacity hitherto provided free of charge.  A lack of transparency in the relationship between Orange and Orange Transit potentially facilitates margin squeezes While examining the case, however, it emerged that, within the context of the lack of formalised internal billing between Orange and Open Transit for access to Orange subscribers, the existence of a margin squeeze situation cannot be excluded, in which Cogent would not have sufficient economic room to propose a competitive offering to content providers, as a result, in particular, of the wholesale price charged by France Télécom for routing content to its Orange subscribers.  In the course of the investigation, only one interconnection agreement between France Télécom and a content provider was identified as being conducive to a margin squeeze. However, this situation appears to result essentially from the strong negotiating power of the website involved, which is very popular, and not to result from France Télécom's deliberate attempt. More generally, however, it did highlight the opacity of the relationship between Orange and Open Transit . Because internal exchanges within the France Télécom group by and between these two entities are not formalised, margin squeezing or even discriminatory practices would be hard to monitor, and as such, easier to carry out . France Télécom has agreed to formalise the relationship between Orange and Open Transit. The aim of these commitments is to prevent margin squeezing and, where applicable, enable the Autorité de la concurrence to detect any such practices. In response to the concerns raised by the Autorité de la concurrence, France Télécom offered to:  - define a formal internal protocol between Orange and Open Transit specifying the technical, operational and financial conditions governing the provision of connectivity services in France ; - implement a system to monitor application of the aforementioned internal protocol . On 3 April 2012, the Autorité de la concurrence published these proposed commitments on its website and launched a market test to collect feedback from stakeholders operating in the sector. Following this market test, and after making a few adjustments at the Board hearing, the Autorité de la concurrence deemed the aforementioned commitments to be appropriate, credible and verifiable, and made them binding. They will enable the Autorité, in the event that a complaint is submitted to it, to verify that France Télécom has not engaged in margin squeezing or discriminatory practices detrimental to competing operators . The internal protocol is to be submitted to the Autorité de la concurrence within three months. The Autorité will monitor implementation of the protocol for a period of two years.

The Conseil de la concurrence (which became ‘Autorité de la concurrence' in March 2009) had been referred this case by the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry . The entire selective distribution network of the Bang & Olufsen brand, made up of 48 distributors, was affected by this sales policy, which covered the entire country . A restriction prohibited by competition law However, a ban on online sales is prohibited by competition law: within a selective distribution system the dealers should be free to sell to all end users, also with the help of the internet . In the Pierre Fabre  case, the Court of Justice of the European Union has recently recalled that a clause in a selective distribution contract banning the distributors from selling the products online amounts to a restriction of competition by object , unless that clause is objectively justified. Bang & Olufsen France has unilaterally limited the commercial freedom of approved distributors , while the online sales channel, had they been allowed to use it, would have allowed them to reach more consumers.  Furthermore, this prohibition limited intra-brand competition (between distributors of the same brand), consequently depriving consumers of lower prices and limiting the choice available to them , especially for consumers living a long way from any point-of-sale. The Autorité ordered a fine of €900,000 as well as an injunction The Autorité imposed a fine of €900,000 on companies Bang & Olufsen France and Bang & Olufsen A/S . It also required Bang & Olufsen France to, modify within three months, its existing selective distribution contracts , in order to make it clear that its approved distributors are authorised to sell online.

Orange and SFR marketed offerings, mainly between 2005 and 2008, allowing for unlimited calls solely within their own networks. These packages, which represented the core of the post paid offering proposed to household customers, gave way to an abusive rate differentiation between ‘on net' calls (within their respective networks) and ‘off net' calls (to rival networks). These offerings put a break on competition in two different ways. They contributed, on the one hand, to freezing the market by drawing consumers to the two biggest networks and keeping them ‘locked in' once their choice was made. They were also liable, on the other hand, to weaken the third operator – Bouygues Télécom –, which had to strike back by launching offerings that significantly increased its costs. > Version française Following a complaint filed by Bouygues Télécom, the Autorité de la concurrence has just issued a decision, by which it fines France Télécom, Orange France and SFR a total of €183.1 million for implementing anticompetitive practices in the mobile telephony sector, by marketing unlimited ‘on net' offerings, that is, by giving their subscribers unlimited calls to interlocutors that were subscribers of the same network. By marketing these offerings, Orange and SFR implemented excessive rate differentiation practices between ‘on net' calls (made within their own network) and ‘off net' calls (to a rival network); thus, they abused the dominant position each of them holds in their respective call termination markets (that is, in the interconnection service they offer other operators by ‘terminating' calls on their networks). (For more information, please refer to Background notes 1 and 2 of the press kit.) Although they seemed attractive at first to consumers, these offerings hampered the market dynamics by keeping subscribers locked in and by weakening Bouygues Télécom, the most likely to stimulate the market, being the latest entrant at the time of the facts. It should be noted that over the last few years, the three operators, Orange, SFR and Bouygues Télécom, have all in turn denounced the implementation, by their competitors, of rate differentiation practices between on net and off net calls, which they unanimously considered to be abusive. Consequently, these complaints gave rise to numerous decisions of the Conseil, and then of the Autorité de la concurrence (for more information, please refer to Background note 3 of the press kit). The unlimited call offerings denounced by Bouygues Télécom As of 2005, Orange and SFR, holding respectively 47% and 36% of the mobile telephony market for household customers, thus a total of 83%, marketed on net unlimited offerings, thus giving their customers unlimited calls to subscribers of the same operator, that is, for an inclusive price, regardless of the quantity and duration of the calls . Orange, for instance, marketed the package lines Orange Classique, Orange Intense and Orange Pro that allowed subscribers to make free calls to three favourite Orange numbers 24/7 without these calls being billed. The “3 N° KDO” (“3 gift-numbers”) option also offered unlimited calls to Orange numbers for packages that did not include an unlimited call component. At SFR's, the lines SFR Essentiel and SFR Evolution Pro offered unlimited calls to three SFR numbers. These offers have not been marketed since the 1st term of 2008 but the many subscribers who have not changed their package still benefit from it today .  These offerings had become the core of the post-paid offer proposed to household customers. As a matter of fact, customers who wished to subscribe to or renew their package with Orange and SFR had no other choice than unlimited call offerings between 2005 and early 2008. Moreover, these offerings contributed up to a third to household customer turnover of SFR and up to over 40% for Orange. This rate differentiation is not objectively justified  All these offers include a rate differentiation between on net and off net calls, the advantage of unlimited calls being reserved solely to on net calls . Orange and SFR did not demonstrate that the rate differentiation between “on net” calls (within their own network) and “off net” calls (to a rival network) were objectively justified, i.e. by a difference between the costs borne for the supply of the two types of calls. They could not either demonstrate that it would be indispensable to the achievement of efficiency gains, prevailing over its anticompetitive effects, particularly since both operators could have marketed unlimited calls offerings to all operators (“cross net” offerings), in which there is no differentiation between both types of call. The practices complained of and implemented by Orange and SFR had several negative effects in the mobile telephony market • These offerings accentuated the « club » effect and damaged the fluidity of the market  These offerings first of all artificially accentuated the “club” effect, that is, the propensity for close relatives to regroup under the same operator , by encouraging consumers to switch operators and join that of their relatives. These offerings played a great role as this factor was, above price, the main incentive for subscriptions (70% of a subscriber's consumption is used towards its three favourite interlocutors). Once the clubs were formed, these offerings “locked” consumers in durably with their operator by significantly raising the exit costs incurred by the subscribers of on net unlimited offerings as well as by their relatives who wish to subscribe to a new offering with a competing operator. The rate differentiation between « on net » and « off net » calls puts off any operator switch because the subscriber or its relatives would consequently no longer be able to make or receive “unlimited” calls.  This differentiation between “on net” and “off net” calls therefore consequently damaged the fluidity of the retail market by hampering customers' migration towards another existing operator . • These offerings automatically favoured large operators over small operators (“network effect”) Since subscribers were interested in calling the largest number of people without these calls being billed, the “on net” unlimited offerings automatically favoured Orange and SFR because they had the largest number of subscribers. In this way, indeed, customers would optimise their chances of finding subscribers of the same operator as them and therefore benefit more from the on net offering. In view of the small size of its subscriber base, Bouygues Télécom (17% of all subscribers) found it impossible to align itself with Orange' and SFR's on net offerings. Bouygues Télécom was consequently obliged to market “cross net” unlimited call offerings allowing its customers to make unlimited calls to their interlocutors, whatever their network (launch of the Néo offering in 2006), but at the expense of a sharp increase in its costs. By launching this offering, Bouygues Télécom had to bear much greater call termination costs, which weakened its ability to stimulate competition in the market. In view of the negative effects of these offerings on its financial health, there was a great danger of Bouygues being driven out of the market . Financial penalties are proportionate with the seriousness of the infringements, with the importance of the harm done to the economy and with the situation of Orange and SFR In order to determine the penalties, the Autorité de la concurrence relied on the method outlined in its Notice of 16 May 2011, with respect to the principle of proportionality and the criteria specified by the Commercial Code.  The Autorité took into account the indisputable seriousness of the infringements, since they reflected abusive pricing practices aiming to weaken smaller competitors or even drive them out of the mobile telephony retail market by significantly increasing their costs. The Autorité, however, also took into account the moderate extent of the harm done to the economy in the case in point; the Bouygues Télécom company was, as a matter of fact, able to remain on the market by proposing “cross net” unlimited call offerings. The Autorité also took account of the elements specific to the behaviour and the individual situation of each company, particularly the fact that all of them were or belonged to a global company, ran varied businesses and had highly significant resources. The amount of the fine imposed on France Télécom includes a 50% additional charge on account of the reiteration, because of six similar infringements of competition law committed over the last fifteen years. Moreover, the Autorité has factored in, for both operators, a mitigating circumstance: the progressive drop in ceiling rates for termination calls imposed by sector regulation created a transitional economic interest for operators to encourage their customers to make “on net” calls. In light of this, the Autorité reduced the amount of the fines imposed on both companies by 50%. The Autorité consequently imposes the following fines: €117,419,000 to the companies Orange France and France Télécom , divided up as follows : €78,279,000 imposed jointly and severally to the companies Orange France and France Télécom, and €39,140,000 imposed on France Télécom; €65,708,000 on the SFR company. > For more information, please consult Decision 12-D-24 of 13 December 2012 on practices implemented in the mobile telephony sector for residential customers (in French) as well as the press kit information (in French): Background Note 1: What is call termination?

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence takes action to restore healthy competition and ensure that the rules be followed in the future A fine and an injunction are imposed to the SNCF > Version française Following the opening of ex officio proceedings in 2008 and a complaint filed by Euro Cargo Rail in 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision, by which it fines SNCF a total amount of €60.9 million for having implemented several practices that hindered or delayed the entrance of new operators in the railway freight sector . These practices amount to an abuse of a dominant position and distorted competition in the specific context of the sector's effective opening to competition from 31 March 2006 onwards. In essence, the penalised practices, on the SNCF's part, were as follow: To have used, in its own commercial interest, confidential strategic information relating to its rivals and which she had access to as Delegated Infrastructure Manager;   To have prevented its rivals, through various means, from accessing rail capacities that were essential to their business (freight yards, train paths, wagons…). THE RAILWAY FREIGHT SECTOR The interested parties The SNCF operates in the freight market through its SNCF Géodis branch (then called Freight branch ) Afterwards, its market share remained very high (77% in the full-train-load market segment in 2009) The customers Shippers are the end customers of rail companies. chemical or steel manufacturers, from the car sector, quarry owners or consumer goods manufacturers full-train-load services have « rail-connected » facilities, which are connected to the national rail network, in order to accommodate trains and unload them THE PENALISED PRACTICES (€60.9 MILLION) The use for commercial purposes, by the SNCF, of confidential information gathered as part of its Infrastructure Manager task      In addition to its freight business, the SNCF is a Delegated Infrastructure Manager (hereinafter DIM) for the Réseau Ferré de France (RFF – French Rail Network), which remunerates the former for such work. As such, when new rail companies request train paths allocations or to visit technical sites, the SNCF gathers sensitive and confidential information on the strategy and business behaviour of its rivals . Thus, it knows, for instance, of the customers canvassed, of the calls for tenders concerned, of the transport plans considered by its competitors (paths used, train length, transported tonnage, schedule, traffic origin and destination, etc.). The dawn-raids carried out in the SNCF's premises established that the Freight branch of the SNCF had access to such confidential information and used it for its own commercial interest. In some cases, it aligned its market strategy with the traffics which were specifically targeted by its rivals (immediate customer contacting in order to define their needs or talk about prices and reasons why a customer wished to switch operators; thorough reviewing of its market strategy in certain geographical areas and for certain types of goods; a posteriori reconstruction of a rival's transport plan on the basis of the supplied information in order to “ take advantage of it ” and to design aggressive and targeted commercial offers). This practice, which cannot be described as “competition on the merits”, artificially hampered the business of the SNCF's competitors and hindered the proper functioning of competition in the sector.  The barriers created to prevent competitors' access to rail capacities Access to freight yards  essential infrastructures for freight rail companies The SNCF is both user and manager of many of these infrastructures when it comes to other rail companies accessing them specifying, transparently and sufficiently clearly, the use and pricing conditions anticipate autonomously rail companies were unable to canvass customers in an efficient manner or to design offerings in a convincing manner The overbooking of train paths that the SNCF deliberately engaged in a train paths overbooking policy on a large scale and did not release the ones it was not using some of them were deterred from participating in certain calls for tenders or were unable to honour already-made orders resort to alternative solutions which debased the quality of service proposed to shippers and increased their costs The overbooking of EX wagons It has been proved that the SNCF kept the exclusive use of the whole EX-wagon fleet, managed by SGW, to itself, and did not use it all after all However, during the first two years after the opening up of the market to competition, EX wagons represented an essential resource on the short term, that would have enabled the SNCF's competitors to enter and develop in the market A financial penalty of €60.9 million PREDATORY PRICING TO SHIPPERS The SNCF applied prices, to some customers and to some traffic, lower than the incurred costs, with an aim to maintain its position on the market and artificially prevent its competitors from entering the market SNCF was experiencing, when the facts occurred, heavy and recurring losses in its railway freight business but did not cover its support and structural costs. For some traffic, the SNCF deliberately drew up offerings regardless of their profitability and used undervalued cost quotations, which enabled it to retain the market An e-mail of 15 December 2006 from the former Sales Director of Fret SNCF, seized during the dawn-raids, illustrates this: “ Referring back to the matter of three-year contracts that would incur losses no matter what (confer our conversation yesterday) (...) In 3 cases, and for defensive reasons, we completed sales at market price regardless of profitability in order to prevent any hegemonic presence of our competitors (Basaltes in Voutre Neuillé, Ineos in Fos Italy, and Eurorail on Epinal Spain). (...) we kept improving our margins without being able to ensure that it was positive. This action was part of our desire to keep penetration by new entrants at A MINIMUM ” (classification mark 38 749). The SNCF, therefore, could maintain – at the expense of competitors at least as efficient as itself – the most important contracts in terms of turnover and the most strategic ones; market penetration by new entrants could only happen on the basis of smaller contracts, less conducive to their development .  The injunction issued To set up, within an 18-months deadline and in successive steps, an analytical accounting system which shall enable a precise identification of the costs incurred by its full-train-load freight business, To ensure that the prices for full-train-load services, proposed to shippers, cover the costs within three years. THE OBJECTIONS THAT WERE NOT RETAINED AGAINST THE SNCF During the investigation, 13 objections were notified to the SNCF. The Autorité de la concurrence set 8 of them aside, deeming that the practices concerned were not established: - Poaching of personnel trained for Véolia Cargo (please see pages 100 to 101 of the Decision/Objection 1);  - Deterrent pricing practice relating to the availability of freight yards (please see pages 99 to 100 of the Decision/Objection 5);  - Discriminatory pricing practices relating to access to SNCF's freight yards by VFLI (Objections 6 et 7), relating to the locomotive rental to Naviland Cargo (Objection 9) and to wagons hire by Ermewa Ferroviaire (Objection 13) ; (please see pages 103 to 106 of the Decision); - Upholding of contracts binding the conventions for the use of freight yards to the railway services (see pages 101 to 102 of the Decision/Objection 12); - Tied selling practices in full-train-load and wagon load services (see pages 102 to 103 of the Decision/ Objection 11); > For more information on this case, please consult Decision 12-D-25 of 18 December 2012 on practices implemented in the railway freight sector (in French)  > Press contact : André Piérard – Tel. : (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 / Contact by email > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th November 2014) > See decisin of the Court of cassation (Supreme Court of Appeal) - 22th November 2016 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (20th December 2018)",

Golf players (or licensees) may take out insurance of their choice, which may differ from that offered by the federation. > Version française   Following a complaint in April 2012 by the company Eurogolf Liber'Tee (hereinafter Eurogolf) regarding practices implemented by the Fédération Française de Golf (hereinafter, FFGolf), the Autorité de la concurrence today issued a decision by which it accepts the commitments made by FFGolf and makes them mandatory. The company Eurogolf, an insurance broker, complained that FFGolf was creating, among its members, confusion between the golf licence itself and supplementary insurance products, which are in reality optional, notably by using the expression “insurance-licence” in its communication. Competition concerns In October 2012 the investigation services expressed their competition concerns to FFGolf. They underlined the confusion between its public service mission (issuing golf licences, an activity for which it holds a legal monopoly) and its economic activity (the marketing of different supplementary insurance products, an activity open to competition). As FFGolf is likely to hold a dominant position in the market of insurance products offered to golfers, and taking into account its links with golf clubs, the inclusion of optional insurance in the federal licence was liable to be considered as “tied selling”, which may be qualified as an abuse of dominant position.  The communication developed by FFGolf and aimed at explaining the mandatory nature of the licence to golfers, could also extend the effects of the potentially abusive tied sale and hinder the emergence of competitors. Finally, the “Cap 500,000” program was such as to contribute to the drying up of the insurance market. The commitments proposed by FFGolf are made mandatory by the Autorité To meet the competition concerns raised by the Autorité, FFGolf submitted competition commitments. These commitments were then improved after a market test .  In the decision issued today, the Autorité makes mandatory – with immediate effect – these commitments, by which FFGolf undertakes, in particular, to: - unbundle the sale of “personal accident” and “repatriation assistance” insurance from the sale of the licence, for the purchase of any new 2013 licence and for the following seasons. The two insurances become, from 2013, paid and optional; - modify all its communication tools that could lead to the risk of confusion described, such that none of these additional insurances proposed by FFGolf may be taken out by golf clubs for the benefit of their players;  - accordingly modify its contractual practice with golf clubs; - modify the contractual documents drawn up within the framework of the Cap 500,000 program for the purposes of making insurance optional and paid.  In the month following the notification of this decision, the FFGolf will inform member golf clubs of these commitments made mandatory by the Autorité so that they can inform players by all appropriate means. The Autorité shall monitor respect for these commitments by FFGolf, which must send the Autorité, for four years, an annual report on the actions carried out to implement these commitments. > Full text of Decision Nr 12-D-29 of 21 December 2012 on practices implemented in the sector of supplementary insurance aimed at golfers  (in French) > Press Contact: André Piérard - Tel: (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 ",

The lack of notification concerning the merging of the Réunica and Arpège groups The Réunica and Arpège social protection groups, which manage complementary retirement schemes, health insurance and benefit institutions, merged their human and material resources and their decision-making bodies on 1 January 2010, without notifying this project to the Autorité de la concurrence. However, taking into account the turnover generated by the two groups , the latter were required to submit the transaction to the Autorité de la concurrence for examination before it was carried out. In the case in point, the merger took effect on 1 January 2010 and Réunica only informed the Autorité de la concurrence in April 2010 that the merger had been carried out. The Réunica group cannot have been unaware that this transaction was subject to review by the Autorité de la concurrence. Indeed, the group has notified the Autorité two other mergersover the past five years, namely the creation of the Réunima joint venture with Groupama in 2007 and the merger with the Bayard group in 2008 .

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following a complaint from pig farmers, the Autorité de la concurrence fines eight pork slaughterers and two professional bodies for several anticompetitive agreements > Version française Following a complaint from four pig farmers from Ille-et-Villaine and the opening of ex officio proceedings, the Autorité issues today a decision whereby it imposes fines for a total amount of €4.57 million for several anticompetitive practices implemented in the pork slaughtering and commercialisation sector . Some of these practices were brought to light thanks to dawn raids completed by the Autorité's Investigation Services in several companies and professional organisations. The main practice sanctioned was the concerted set up of the quantity of pigs bought by five major Breton slaughterers ( Abera, Bernard, Gad, Groupe Bigard and Socopa Viandes ), with the aim to, in particular, lower the prices paid to pig farmers – the fines issued in this regard amount to a total of €4,512,621. The Autorité also fined the slaughter houses professional body, named ‘ French Meat Association ' (formerly known as the SNCP ), for sending pricing instructions and for other anticompetitive agreements between slaughterers, of a lesser extent and duration. Most of the companies and bodies involved (8 out of 10) challenged neither the facts, nor their legal qualification, nor their responsibility with regard to these infringements. Moreover, some of them undertook commitments for the future , thus gaining further fine reductions. In total, the fines are imposed as follows: Slaughtering companies Total amount of fines        imposed, in €  Professional bodies              Total amount of fines        imposed, in € Fédération des acheteurs au cadran  In 2009, five slaughterers consulted with each other for several months, in order to lower in a coordinate manner their purchase of pigs, at the expense of pig farmers The pork slaughtering companies, Abera, Bernard, Gad, Groupe Bigard and Socopa Viandes , agreed to reduce, in a coordinate manner, their pork slaughtering in 2009, over successive periods covering a total of 12 weeks. This concerted reduction in slaughter aimed at affecting the price of pigs in the Marché du porc breton (MPB) , which serves as a price index on a national scale. In fact, the artificial reduction in the demand for live pigs caused significant price drops at the expense of farmers-producers . This practice was implemented by the major slaughterhouses (which represent 70% of pork purchases at the MPB and 50% of pork purchases in the “ Uniporc Ouest ” area, which itself represents 80% of the French pig-breeding business), towards pig farmers, who were ill equipped to escape the effects of this secret anticompetitive agreement . Indeed, the animals' maturity governs their sale window, with regard to the quality requirements for pig meat. None of the 5 slaughterers involved challenged having implemented these practices . The Syndicat national du commerce de porc (French Pork Trade Association, SNCP) sent price instructions to its members, over several years and repeatedly, with an aim to counter special offers applied by food retailers on fresh pig meat for cutting . Traditionally, food retailers apply special offers on pig meat in January and September. Deeming these very low pricing levels to be “ harmful to the sector's profitability and image ”, the SNCP repeatedly sent advisories and circulars between December 2004 and August 2009 . These documents called for slaughterers not to sell their pig meat to food retail chains below a certain reference price . These price instructions, which constituted anticompetitive practices, were disseminated during several promotional periods, in spite of a formal warning issued by the department for fraud control of the Minister for the Economy . The SNCP did not challenge having implemented such practices. A €10,800 fine was imposed regarding these practices. Other anticompetitive agreements were also fined The slaughterhouses Cooperl Arc-Atlantique and Gad were fined respective totals of €13,288 and €1,097 for entering, in May and June 2009, into an anticompetitive agreement directed against the Auchan retail chain, on a minimum price for the sale of boneless pork loins and on the prices of meat subject to special offers on a national scale in some of this retail chain's stores. These practices artificially increased the price of the pig meat sold to these stores and consequently to the end consumer . In addition, seven slaughterers ( Abera, AIM Groupe, Bernard, Cooperl Arc-Atlantique, Gad, Groupe Bigard and Kermené ), along with the SNCP and the Fédération des acheteurs au cadran (Auction Market Buyers Federation, FAC ), were fined for setting together, on 2 and 5 September 2005, when the auction market was down, a unique price for their direct purchases from farmers . The SNCP instructed the price to be applied in an advisory sent to all slaughterhouses. Considering the very short duration of this last infringement, and its limited effects, the fines issued with respect to this infringement range from between €2,700 and €7,000. Fines that are proportionate to the individual situation of each company or body, in the tough economic conditions for the pig farming sector The Autorité de la concurrence, when setting the amount of the fines, took into account the seriousness of the facts and the extent – highly limited in most cases – of the harm done by the identified practices to the economy. The Autorité also adjusted the amount of the fines to the individual situation of each company and organisation penalised . In this regard, it took into consideration the fact that some of the companies involved were single-product companies, therefore mostly active in the sector concerned only. The companies Gad, Abera and Bernard thus got fine reductions of respectively 60%, 50% and 50% . In its assessment of the fines, the Autorité also took into account the various elements linked to the difficult economic context affecting the operators of the pig sector , in addition to the existence of a strong counter-power held by food retailers. Eight of the ten companies involved did not challenge the objections and some of them made compliance commitments, thus gaining an additional fine reduction The eight companies and organisations that did not challenge the objections notified by the Investigation Services of the Autorité de la concurrence ( Abera, AIM, Bernard, Gad, Groupe Bigard, Socopa Viandes, the French Meat Association – former SNCP – and the FAC ) benefitted from a reduction in their fines with this regard. In addition, three of them chose to adopt an Antitrust Compliance Programme in order to prevent the repetition of such practices . They obtained an additional fine reduction ; the fine reduction in the matter of settlement and commitment procedures therefore reached 18%. Bernard and Groupe Bigard - Socopa Viandes undertake to implement an Antitrust Compliance Programme, providing for the set up of an audit and control system , training activities, as well as a regular control of the efficient implementation of the programme.    AIM and HAIM undertake to implement an Antitrust Compliance Programme, providing notably for written instructions to employees dealing with suppliers, customers and competitors, training activities and the set up of an audit and control system . Finally, the companies Gad and Financière du Forest having put forward financial difficulties, an additional fine reduction was applied to them, taking account of these companies' diminished ability to pay. Consequently, the fine imposed on these companies with regard to the main infringement (production limitation) was reduced by over 80%, going from €1,313,420 down to €250,000.  The regulation of the functioning of the Breton pig market and competition rules Within the framework of its decision, the Autorité took notice of the amendments brought on by the parties, on their own initiative, to certain aspects of the functioning of the Breton pig market. This functioning in itself was not questioned in the context of the case that resulted in this decision .       To the contrary, the Autorité took account , both in its analysis of the practices and in the determination of the fines, of the mechanisms implemented within the Breton pig market in order to ensure some stability in the price fluctuations generated, notably, by the volatility of raw material prices.       In light of this context as well, the Autorité dismissed one of the objections notified to the companies, noticing that some of the exchanged information on potential purchase conduct intentions were not anticompetitive practices within the specific context of the bi-weekly auction market regulating the Breton pig sector. > Full text of Decision 13-D-03 on practices implemented in the pork pig sector (in French) > Press contact: André Piérard / Tel.: (+33) 1 55 04 02 28 / Contact by email > See decision of Paris Court of Appeal 25 September 2014",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following a complaint from the Teva Santé company (ranked 3rd manufacturer of generic medicine in France), the Autorité de la concurrence today issued a decision, whereby it fines Sanofi-Aventis a total of €40.6 million for implementing a denigration strategy. This strategy was aimed for healthcare professionals (doctors and dispensary pharmacists) and against generic versions of Plavix®, with a goal to limit their entry in the market and favour Sanofi-Aventis' own products, the originator Plavix® medicine and its generic version marketed by Sanofi-Aventis, Clopidogrel Winthrop® .  Plavix® is a medicine used to prevent relapses of serious cardiovascular diseases. It stands as a “blockbuster” in the pharmaceutical industry: as the world's 4th best-seller, it represented, in 2008, the higher amount of a medicine reimbursement by the Assurance Maladie – French public health care system –, that is, €625 million) . In 2010, the Autorité de la concurrence issued a first decision on this case, whereby it had dismissed a request for interim measures and decided to proceed with the investigation on the merits of the case (see press release and decision 10-D-16 of 17 May 2010 ). Plavix® and its patents Sanofi-Aventis, a subsidiary of the Sanofi group and French leader of the pharmaceutical industry, began to market Plavix® in France in February 1999. Plavix® medicine's active ingredient is clopidogrel. It was granted a marketing authorisation (“autorisation de mise sur le marché”, hereinafter “MA”) on 15 July 1998 and falls under the antiplatelet medicine category. It is mainly prescribed by general practitioners and cardiologists in private practice, in the framework of ambulatory care. The Plavix® medicine is used to prevent complications from atherothrombosis , a disease resulting in arterial stiffness and which may lead to lesions on artery walls and cases of thrombosis (blood clots). Even though the patent protecting this medicine in Europe expired in July 2008, Sanofi-Aventis filed complementary patents in order to extend this initial protection: The type of salt use in Plavix (hydrogen sulfate) remained protected until February 2013 and, consequently, the generic versions of Plavix®, apart from the one marketed by Sanofi-Aventis itself, had to use a different salt; \t The instruction on treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in double therapy, through the combination of clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), also remains protected by the patent due to expire in February 2017. The variations in salts and therapeutic indications of Plavix®'s generic competitors, only due to intellectual property issues rather than to specific chemical or medical characteristics, have no impact on the bioequivalence and substitutability of these medicines ; this goes for all pathologies treated by Plavix®, including ACS. Indeed, as soon as a specialty generic is listed in the generics' directory, no legal or regulatory provision may prevent its prescription in substitution to the reference specialty, even if the specialty generic did not provide all the therapeutic indications of the latter. In this context, the Afssaps pointed out to the Autorité's services that “ the applications for MA of clopidogrel in a form other than hydrogen sulphate (the salt in PLAVIX) presented, in addition to a study on bioequivalence to the PLAVIX specialty, data demonstrating the safety and efficiency of the different salt (clopidogrel besilate or clopidogrel hydrochloride). It stems from the above, that the variation in salt does not forbid a specialty being classified as generic, and, therefore, it does not constitute an obstacle to substitutability ”. The first clopidogrel generic competitors of Sanofi-Aventis were marketed at the beginning of October 2009. The practice implemented by Sanofi-Aventis Sanofi-Aventis implemented a global and structured communication strategy, with an aim to influence doctors and pharmacists in order to stop the generic substitution process at two key stages: At the prescription stage , by convincing doctors to insert the indication “non substitutable” to the prescriptions, so as to limit the substitution of Plavix® by a generic medicine; \t At the substitution stage itself, by encouraging pharmacists to substitute Plavix® by its own generic medicine, Clopidogrel Winthrop®, to the detriment of generic competitors. This communication was implemented from September 2009 to January 2010, at the exact time when specialty generic competitors were introduced in the market. It results from many testimonies from doctors and pharmacists, as well as from feedback from the Caisse nationale d'Assurance maladie des travailleurs salariés (CNAMTS, French public health care system) and information provided by the retail pharmacist associations Giropharm and Réseau Santé, that medical visitors and pharmaceutical representatives from Sanofi-Aventis spread, at national level and to doctors and pharmacists, views shedding doubt on the efficiency and innocuousness of generic competitors of Plavix®. They also implied that these professionals could be held liable if medical problems should arise following the prescription and/or sale of these substitution medicines . Substantial feedback provided by the CNAMTS establishes that doctors were greatly influenced by this discourse. Here are a few examples: In the Champagne-Ardenne area: “ antigeneric communication from MV [medical visitor] to pharmacies with an aim to prevent the substitution of Plavix®, unless the generic medicine should be Wintrop. A communication that was sometimes aggressive : such substitution (except in the case of the Wintrop generic medicine marketed by the same brand) would be a « murderous » behaviour. Main argument : the salt difference. Communication of the MV to doctors in order to encourage “NS” [non-substitution] . Death cases linked to Plavix® substitution were mentioned by the MV […] ” (paragraph 183 of the decision) In the Nord-Pas-de-Calais area, the speeches identified mentioned in particular an “endangerment of patients if plavix or its generic from the same brand is not prescribed”, and a “defamation of other generic medicines by insisting on the pharmacist's liability in a case a patient suffered complications following the substitution ” (paragraph 186 of the decision). In the Rhône-Alpes area, “ pharmacies notice numerous “NS” indications on the medical prescriptions for clopidogrel (50% of medical prescriptions, because labs “terrorised” doctors with their speeches) and voice their discontent: ‘we must fight the disinformation spread by the labs every time a generic products enters the market' ” (paragraph 247 of the decision). In the Centre area, cardiologists “ systematically add on to their prescription the indication “non substitutable ”. In the Midi-Pyrénées area, “ both general practitioners and pharmacists do not wish to take any risks by prescribing or selling the generic product because there are doubts regarding the therapeutic efficiency of the generic products marketed (doubts on efficiency, concerns over medical consequences). Doctors therefore add the indication “non substitutable” on the prescriptions and chemists do not substitute or they reference the generic produced by Sanofi-Aventis, Winthrop ”. (paragraph 500 of the decision) In the Picardie area, “ general practitioners and cardiologists do not wish to take any risks; consequently, more and more do the indications “PLAVIX NS”, even sometime “CLOPIDOGREL WINTHROP NS”, appear on prescriptions .” (paragraph 501 of the decision) Likewise, numerous pharmacists reported that they chose to order the generic medicine marketed by Sanofi-Aventis, Clopidogrel Winthrop®, to avoid being held liable. Among the many examples identified, here is a testimony of a retail pharmacist located in Pierrelatte: “ We sell the generic medicine of the Winthrop labs because it is made with the same salt as Plavix and we do not want to be held liable if we associated with the Kardegic. On this subject, the pharmacy's employees were very convinced by the SANOFI labs' discourse on the concept of liability upon delivery, in resulting cases of strokes and heart attacks (there are risks involved when mixing kardegic and a generic medicine other than winthrop) ” (paragraph 494 of the decision). Finally, the pharmacists' associations Giropharm and Réseau Santé had to distribute circulars to their members, so as to counter the “misinformation campaign” ran by Sanofi-Aventis and to restore scientific facts. Here are some extracts: “ The salt used in the medicine is not critical element of its efficiency”; “The absence of a specific therapeutic indication (i.e. certain combinations with salicyclic acid) is not due to a possible lack of efficiency of generics, but to the fact that they were patented at a later date than the other therapeutic indications ”. (paragraph 195 of the decision) “ Sanofi tried to do with the “salts” what it had done with the “Excipients known to have a recognised action”. Let's be objective: we understand Sanofi's motives (see above) when opposing generic medicines for its flagship product. However, today, Afssaps did not hold the difference in salts to be a valid argument to prohibit Plavix's generic medicines, and it referenced the molecule in the generics directory. The influence of the salts is becoming a non-argument, which chemists cannot be fooled by: no serious publication can justify Winthrop's position ”. (paragraph 197 of the decision) A serious practice, which substantially curbed the substitution process of Plavix® by generics Sanofi-Aventis' discourse created uncertainty about the quality and safety of generic medicines, without any evidence for basis since nothing shows that Plavix®'s competing generics are less safe that the originator . In this regard, the Autorité stresses that Sanofi-Aventis filed no appeal against the MAs that were granted by Afssaps. Furthermore, Sanofi-Aventis was free to submit to the healthcare authorities any information it had relating to the safety and efficiency of the Plavix® generics, not only within the framework of MA procedures, but also within that of pharmacovigilance. But it did not bring to the attention of the healthcare authorities, after conclusion of the scientific debate before them, any argument that would allow for uncertainty about the quality and innocuousness of the Plavix® generics. This misleading discourse gave rise to real concerns among healthcare professionals; all the more widely echoed that: Plavix® and its generics are used to treat very serious cardio-vascular conditions (life-threatening illnesses for the patient) and that their taking requires a specific follow-up insofar as it may increase the risk of haemorrhages; \t in general, healthcare professionals are weary of new medicinal products for which insufficient time was available for evaluation; \t there remains, moreover, among healthcare professionals, some reluctance towards generic medicines; it can be explained in particular by their ignorance of MA procedures, by their wrong appreciation of the regulatory framework on substitution and by their will to protect themselves from being held liable, in either civil or criminal terms. An abnormally low substitution rate Case documents show that the substitution rate for Plavix® follows a very atypical pattern. Indeed, despite great volumes and turnover, as well as numerous generic labs operating in the market, this rate, after it soared when generic were introduced, then experienced a steady decline for numerous months; no other similar molecule experienced such a pattern, as shown in the graph below:   As the price of a generic medicine is significantly lower that the price of the reference originator (the discount is usually set at 55% of the manufacturer's price, excluding VAT), savings of more that €200 million were expected in the 2010 results by the Ministry of Healthcare, thanks to the launch of Plavix® generics; it was expected that these generics should account for 75% of all sales by end 2010. However, in its report on the results for 2010, the Sécurité sociale (Public health care system) notes that “the effective penetration rate of the clopidogrel at end-December 2010 [was] lower by 10 points than the targeted rate (64.6% vs. 75%)”. If the Sécurité sociale's aim does not constitute a precise and indisputable reference for what should have prevailed in the absence of anticompetitive practice, it provides nonetheless an order of magnitude which confirms that the rate of introduction of Plavix® generics was significantly lower that it should have been. Plavix® representing the higher amount of a medicine reimbursement by the Assurance Maladie, the amount of forgone revenue is therefore substantial for public accounts. An atypical market share for the generic medicine marketed by Sanofi-Aventis, at the expense of other generic labs The practice at stake also resulted in an exceptional penetration rate for Sanofi-Aventis' own generic medicine, Clopidogrel Winthrop® (now called Clopidogrel Zentiva®). This product enjoys a market share of over 34% in the clopidogrel generics segment; in other words its market share is four times greater than the one usually held by Sanofi-Aventis in the French generic medicine market. A practice constituting an abuse of a dominant position On the basis of all these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence found that Sanofi-Aventis abused its dominant position in the French market of clopidogrel prescribed by ambulatory care, and therefore breached Article L.420-2 of the Commercial Code, as well as Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The practices identified are particularly serious and justify the €40.6 million fine imposed on this company.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines a cartel, between the four major distributors of commodity chemicals operating in France, a total amount of €79 million > Version française  Today, the Autorité de la concurrence issued a decision whereby it fines a cartel between Brenntag, Caldic Est, Univar and Solvadis, a total amount of €79 million. The anticompetitive agreement between these distributors of commodity chemicals restricted competition by allocating customers among the parties and coordinating prices. The practices at issue were observed in the Bourgogne and Rhône-Alpes regions, and in the North and the West of France. The Autorité considered that these practices were part of a global and single strategy . The undertakings concerned total more than 80% of the commodity chemicals distribution market in France. Very many undertakings on the downstream side of the market (industrial companies, SMEs) have been harmed by these practices, and the majority of French industrial areas have been affected, with the exception of the Ile-de-France and South-West regions. Solvadis, which had applied for leniency, was granted immunity from penalty; it would otherwise have been liable to a fine of €13 million . It was the first to report the existence of the cartel to the Autorité de la concurrence. The case originated from a leniency application The Autorité de la concurrence (at the time the Conseil de la concurrence) was informed of the existence of this cartel by Solvadis, which applied to benefit from the leniency procedure. The Brenntag and Univar groups then successively applied for leniency. Under certain conditions, the leniency procedure allows an undertaking, which informs the Autorité de la concurrence of a cartel in which it took part, to benefit from a full or partial immunity from fines, in particular on the basis of the rank of arrival of its leniency application, the ‘added value' of the information given as well as its full cooperation with the Autorité to establish the existence of the infringement ( more about the leniency procedure - in French).  Since the procedure was introduced into French law in 2001, the Autorité has received 61 leniency applications and issued 7 rulings . The commodity chemicals distribution sector The sector concerned in the decision issued by the Autorité is the distribution of chemical products, and, more specifically the distribution of commodity chemicals. Commodity chemicals, produced by the major chemical groups (Exxon, Shell, BP, Solvay, Rhodia, BASF, etc.) are basic raw materials produced in particular from inorganic chemistry and petrochemistry such as solvents, alcohols, acids, ethers, bleach, soda …  They are used in a large number of sectors : the chemical, agro-food and automobile industries, hospital and private laundries, water treatment, armaments, the concrete industry, the disinfection and cleaning industry, paint manufacturing, the mechanical and aeronautical industries, the textile industry, etc. Commodity chemicals are either sold directly by the producers when large volumes are requested, or marketed by intermediaries, such as distributors, for smaller volumes. The practices at issue were implemented by the distributors, as illustrated in the diagram below .   A specific regulatory and economic context Commodity chemicals are products that can be dangerous (sometimes inflammable, toxic or explosive). For this reason, they are subject to strict regulation, under the so-called “Seveso” Directive. This Directive is aimed at guaranteeing the safety of products, populations and the environment by laying down rules for their quality and their storage and transport conditions. This Directive accordingly requires suppliers and distributors to invest in the facilities housing these products. This context combined with vigorous price competition impacted distributors' profits. They therefore decided to establish a joint strategy aiming to pacify the market by putting an end to the “price war” which had been initiated by Brenntag, and to restore their margins .  A participant to the cartel summarised the situation as follows (paragraphs 74 to 88 of the Decision):   “ Brenntag had just taken over the Orchidis company and started charging very low prices for commodity chemicals in the hope of weakening local businesses and thus opening the way to possible takeovers in the Rhône-Alpes area. In particular, in order to withstand competitive pressure, the Favre and Vaissière businesses merged into 1995. All the local companies were forced to take part in this price war, even though this strategy weakened the various businesses. Brenntag also experienced a sharp downturn in profits in the region. In my opinion, Mr. Z…, who knew the various company directors of the local sites, and in order to bring Brenntag's profits back up, took the initiative of gathering together all the region's representatives with a view to forming an agreement on inorganic chemicals and on the charging of technical costs. Discussions very soon brought up solvents and an agreement on pricing and the allocation of volumes was established (…). We progressively increased prices in order to recover the margins ”.  Price coordination and customer allocation The cartel arrangements were put in place between 1998 and mid-2005 in the four geographic areas where the storage sites of the commodity chemical distributors concerned were generating the lowest profits: Bourgogne, Rhône-Alpes, West and North . Representatives of the companies Solvadis, Brenntag, Univar and Caldic, when operating in the relevant area, would meet secretly on a regular basis in hotels or restaurants or communicate on the phone, sometimes on dedicated lines in order to avoid these calls being traced, in order to allocate customers and coordinate prices.  Customer allocation A distinction was made between customers who regularly issued calls for tenders from those who did not. Those who did so were allocated in “turns” : they were supplied alternatingly by the different participants to the cartel. This system was based on cover bids resulting in the offer of a distributor appointed by the members of the cartel appearing as the best offer. As for the second category of customers, less sensitive to prices and more loyal to distributors, each distributor agreed to refrain from actively poaching these customers by entering into a non-aggression pact . This led to a freeze in each distributor's customer portfolio.  The documents or statements show for example (see paragraphs 124 to 386 of the Decision: - “to take” the customer - “Q +F means that Brenntag must not compete with Quarréchim and Vaissière-Favre [Univar], who share the client between themselves. Brenntag must therefore submit a cover bid” - “to cover” - “Caldic 2002 coverage”, “100% Caldic” - “these are customers who were either shared or reserved. The letters “B” and “C” refer to the distributor who was to supply the client” Price coordination cartel prices joint prices – “The aim was to discuss the prices, fix floor prices for the sale of soda lye and allocate the customers.” – “We reached agreements on the price level to apply depending on the packaging and the place where the product was delivered.” – “I would discuss by telephone the sale price to charge in agreement with the competitors to retain a volume of business with these customers.” Monitoring arrangements The cartel's implementation was closely monitored in order to make sure that no participant deviated from the rules defined. Checks could be performed with customers and reminders issued on the cartel's operating rules. Here are a few examples (see paragraphs 124 to 386 of the Decision):  – “Brenntag called Mr. Q… because RPC-Clément [Solvadis] had diverted an order from us by offering very low prices to Heineken. We wanted to know what was happening”  – “on 6/1/99, Cartonnerie de Gravelines, 85 instead of 90, -> Call U…” Large-scale collusion among the principal distributors of commodity chemicals that impacted almost all their customers, particularly SMEs The ample evidence and numerous statements gathered established the existence of a cartel in at least four geographic zones covering a large part of the French territory (34 départments). With the exception of Ile-de-France and the South-West regions, the vast majority of French industrial areas were affected by these practices. Major industrial groups (Thomson, Seb, Saint-Gobain, etc.) and numerous SMEs, such as laundries, as well as hospital service authorities (the Dijon University Hospital, for example) were thus the victims of the cartel, being made to pay more for their supply of raw materials.  A cartel is one of the most serious infringement to competition law, given that it steals, to the benefit of the perpetrator, the profit that the undertakings downstream in the value chain and the customers – in this case industrial customers or small or medium-sized businesses, even public authorities and buyers of commodity chemicals – are entitled to expect from normal competition. This practice was all the more serious in this case, since it affected several key parameters of competition simultaneously (price, customers). The fines imposed The Autorité set the amount of the fines, having regard, in particular, to the arrival rank of the leniency applications submitted by some of the companies involved and the evidence they submitted. On this basis, it granted total immunity to Solvadis, the first undertaking to have spontaneously denounced its involvement and revealed the existence of the cartel (it would have been liable to a penalty of €13 million). GEA Group, which did not apply for leniency was, however, fined as the parent company of Solvadis at the time the offence was committed. Brenntag and Univar, the second and third applicants for leniency, had their penalties reduced by 25% and 20% respectively under the leniency procedure. As regards Brenntag, the Autorité also took into consideration its central role within the cartel: as the pivot of the cartel, it started it in three regions and carried out its monitoring.

The “charter” governing the relations between veterinary surgeons and the Strasbourg SPA dictated the prices to be charged and organised market sharing between the veterinary surgeons The CROV of Alsace and SNVEL 67 “ fixed  the price of care and services (…) to animals housed in this refuge by veterinary surgeons who had signed up to this charter ”. The prices charged were therefore identical whichever veterinary surgeon carried out the work at the refuge. The fee structure also covered certain care provided after the animal's adoption (in particular spaying or neutering) via vouchers given by the SPA to adopters. The veterinary surgeons who were signatories of the charter also “ took turns ” with the SPA according to a schedule drawn up before the start of each year. This rotation allowed member veterinary surgeons to share out the turnover generated by these interventions equally and meant that no-one could corner the whole of the relevant market. Practices that caused damage to the Strasbourg SPA for 17 years This agreement particularly affected the Strasbourg SPA, which was deprived of the benefits of competition between 1991 and 2008, since almost all the veterinary surgeons in the city of Strasbourg had signed up to the charter. The fines imposed In setting the amount of the fines, the Autorité de la concurrence paid particular regard to the severity of the practices, their duration and the damage done to the economy.

The CROV of Alsace, SNVEL 67 and the Regional Union of Self-employed Veterinary Surgeons of Haut-Rhin (SDVEL 68) are also fined for having sought to extend the agreement to all the SPAs of Alsace.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following a complaint by the Solaire Direct company regarding practices implemented by EDF, the Autorité de la concurrence today handed down a decision imposing a fine of 13.543 million euros on EDF for having abused its dominant position (1) by implementing anticompetitive practices in the emerging market for photovoltaic solar power offered to individual consumers. These offers involved the installation of solar panels on the roofs of private homes for the purpose of selling the energy produced to EDF, which is required by law to purchase electricity produced from solar photovoltaic cells. As a reminder, before today's decision on the merits of the case, a decision imposing interim remedies (2) was handed down on 8 April 2009. In today's decision, the Autorité de la concurrence established that EDF had favoured its subsidiary EDF ENR by making various resources available to it that could not be replicated by competitors: EDF Bleu Ciel brand as well as its resources for the prospection, promotion and marketing of photovoltaic offers via Conseil Energie Solaire, the brand image and reputation of EDF, EDF ENR logo and trademark, that are similar to those used by the incumbent operator, and finally, the customer database of the former monopoly that contain more than 20 million names and addresses. EDF thus created confusion in the minds of consumers between its public service activity of electricity supply and the operations of its photovoltaic solar power subsidiary. To promote the services of its subsidiary, EDF maintained confusion in the mind of consumers between its public service activity of supplying electricity and its photovoltaic power services The confusion was maintained between November 2007 and April 2009, through a marketing system based on the means of communication from the parent company and the use of the brand image of EDF electricity supplier. The marketing system: EDF ENR took advantage of the ‘striking force' of the 'Bleu Ciel d'EDF' brand ‘Bleu Ciel d'EDF' brand is the trademark under which the EDF Group sells its services to individual consumers, especially the regulated offer of electricity supply. During this period, EDF used this trademark that is clearly identified with the electricity supply by the former monopoly by mobilising the entire range of its communication tools, directing individuals liable to be interested in photovoltaic electricity to the Conseil Energie Solaire [Solar Energy Advice Service], in a systematic process whose stages can be summarised as follows: The Lettre Bleu Ciel (an “info-invoice” brochure produced in more than 20 million copies and enclosed with electricity bills) nos. 1 and 2 in 2007 and 2008 which promoted solar energy by inviting EDF customers to contact their customer service (telephone platform 3929). Electricity bills also stated the number ‘39 29'. The unique telephone number 3929 gave access to both EDF's customer service as the electricity supplier and to the Conseil Energie Solaire, thus misleading consumers as to the distinction between these group entities. Initially, the Conseil Energie Solaire presented itself as providing general and impartial information to the consumer. Subsequently, if the prospect showed interest, the EDF advisor would systematically direct the customer to another of EDF's own services which was, in fact, without specifying this to the individuals, acting on behalf of its subsidiary EDF ENR, but which sold its photovoltaic services under the brand name Bleu Ciel d'EDF. It was only at the end of the sales process, after signing the contract, that customers were informed that they had entered into a contract with EDF ENR rather than with EDF. At trade shows and fairs, in Bleu Ciel retail outlets, in the documents provided by EDF to prospects (invitations, visiting cards, subscription forms), there was nothing that would enable a consumer to know that the offer being made came from a group's subsidiary that is distinct from the EDF supplier, namely EDF ENR, whose name was not shown anywhere. As the Autorité has already stated on several occasions (3), if the use of the brand name and reputation of the incumbent operator does not constitute an abuse in itself, this usage may become anticompetitive when it leads to creating confusion between a public service activity (the supply of electricity at regulated tariffs) and a competitive activity (the sale of photovoltaic cells). The brand name of the incumbent operator: a competitive advantage that competitors cannot replicate  EDF thus allowed its subsidiary EDF ENR to use the brand image and reputation of the incumbent operator, EDF, as well as its material and human resources, to market its solar power products. By thus creating confusion in the minds of consumers with respect to the role of the various entities within the EDF group in the solar power sector and by taking unique advantage of the reputation of its brand, EDF allowed its EDF ENR subsidiary to benefit from a competitive advantage that was non-replicable and was not based on its own merits. The details of the case file show that at the time these practices were in operation, the EDF brand played a decisive role in consumer choice as to which would be chosen to provide solar power services. Furthermore, the competitive advantage was increased through the financial conditions of these resources. EDF played on the similarity of the logos and brands to favour its subsidiary In implementing the interim injunctions imposed by the Conseil de la concurrence in April 2009, EDF ended the promotion and marketing of offers from EDF ENR through the Bleu Ciel d'EDF brand and the Conseil Energie Solaire supported by the telephone number 3929. The solar power offers from EDF ENR then ceased to be marketed mainly under the Bleu Ciel d'EDF brand and were transferred to the EDF ENR brand, with this trademark and logo bearing significant similarities to those of the incumbent operator EDF. Use of the EDF ENR brand and logo after April 2009 also gave the subsidiary a non-replicable advantage that was of such a nature as to restrict competition, in view of the characteristics of the market and especially the customers' needs. Customers were legitimately worried by the large investment necessary and risks of poor workmanship, so they were ‘reassured' by the EDF brand, which they trusted as the incumbent supplier of electricity. The impact was all the greater since this is an irreversible investment (photovoltaic panels have a lifespan of about 20 years), which ‘blocks' the market for future competitors. This advantage was amplified by the financial conditions granted by EDF to its subsidiary for using the brand. Use of the trademark no longer constituted an advantage after mid-2010, when the market switched in favour of local companies. EDF also abused its dominant position by using its customer database to favour the marketing of the products of its EDF ENR subsidiary Between November 2007 and April 2009, EDF used its electricity supplier customer database to favour the marketing of the service offers of its subsidiary EDF ENR. This customer database was used to circulate the Lettre Bleu Ciel, a brochure enclosed with EDF bills, and on the bills themselves, both these media referring to the telephone platform 39 29 and the Conseil Energie Solaire. As the Autorité has recalled in previous opinions (4), ‘the use, by a company that has currently or that has in the past had a legal monopoly in the market, of information held in connection with this market, to develop its operations in a second market, one that is open to competition, for example by promoting this activity to customers resulting from the legal monopoly, constitutes in principle an anticompetitive practice'. The use of inside information held exclusively by EDF under its former monopoly (more than 20 million names and addresses, with the data being regularly updated by clients) constituted a significant advantage for EDF ENR which enabled it to promote its offers to a large number of prospects, under conditions that could not be replicated by competitors. These competitors, consisting of SMEs whose brands were unknown, were adversely affected in the long term by all of these practices which, from the outset, disrupted any real possibility of competition. The companies that were present in the marketplace were thus so weakened that almost all of them eventually disappeared, when the uncertainties over the price of the resale of solar power caused a slowdown in demand and an explosion in the cost of acquiring customers. > Full text of Decision Nr 13-D-20 of 17 December 2013 concerning the practices implemented by EDF in the photovoltaic solar power sector ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following a complaint filed by the Arrow génériques laboratory, The Autorité de la concurrence has imposed a 15.3 million euro fine on the Schering-Plough laboratory for disparagement of the generic by the Arrow laboratory which is in competition with its originator medicinal product Subutex®, and for granting unwarranted discounts to pharmacists in order to curb the entry of the generic product. The Autorité has also fined an anticompetitive agreement between Schering-Plough and its supplier Reckitt Benckiser, which purpose was to implement a strategy of closing off competitors. For the record, in 2007 the Autorité de la concurrence issued interim injunctions instructing Schering-Plough to publish a statement in the specialized press reminding doctors and pharmacists of the strict bioequivalence of Subutex® with the competing generic products, and of the fact that substitution by the generic poses no risk to patient health (see press release and decision 07-MC-06, confirmed by the Paris Court of Appeal and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)). The Subutex market® and the complaint lodged by Arrow Subutex® (Buprenorphine molecule) is a medicinal product prescribed for the treatment of opiate addiction (particularly heroin) of drug addicts. In 1997, Schering-Plough acquired exclusive sales rights for Subutex® in France from Reckitt Benckiser (manufacturer of Subutex®). In return, Schering-Plough paid royalties to Reckitt Benckiser (a percentage of turnover). In March 2006, Arrow launched its generic equivalent. Following the launch of its generic product and the difficulties the laboratory faced in penetrating the market, Arrow brought the matter before the Autorité de la concurrence, deeming that Schering-Plough was abusing its dominant position to exclude it from the market. The general plan devised by Schering-Plough and Reckitt Benckiser to block the arrival of Subutex® generics In anticipation of the arrival of Subutex® generics in 2006, between October and December 2005 Schering-Plough and Reckitt Benckiser adopted a French plan against generics, with the goal of \"Delaying/Discouraging the entry of generic products\". The main themes of this plan were firstly, \"bioequivalence\" and \"health issues\", and secondly \"Minimising the market penetration of generics\" for \"direct sales to pharmacies\" and through \"customer loyalty schemes\". Reckitt Benckiser and Schering-Plough together decided that Schering-Plough's communication would be based on differences between the originator product and the Arrow generic related to appearance, dissolution and excipients, the idea being to instil \"doubts\" in the minds of doctors and pharmacists as to a change of treatment as regards the \"psychiatric instability” of the patient and the \"risk of misuse and trafficking” of the Subutex® generic. In addition, Reckitt Benckiser and Schering-Plough agreed to saturate pharmacy aisles, by giving pharmacists a financial incentive to order large quantities of Subutex®. The implementation of Schering-Plough's plan Schering-Plough disparaged the Arrow generic and granted discounts to pharmacists with the purpose of saturating their aisles with Subutex®. • A global and structured disparagement campaign From mid-February to May 2006, Schering-Plough organised seminars and telephone meetings and prepared sales pitch templates for its medical and pharmaceutical representatives so that they could disseminate an alarmist message to doctors and pharmacists on the risks of prescribing or dispensing the Arrow generic, even though it did not have access to any specific medical study to justify such a position. For example, during a training seminar for medical representatives, they were asked to \"instil certain “doubts” in the minds of pharmacists regarding change\" (\"2006 pharmacy strategy - Communicate information on the specificities of drug addicts, and the specific nature of care: instil certain “doubts” regarding change (psyc. comorbidities, risk of misuse and trafficking)/paragraph 369 of the decision Schering-Plough's CEO reproduced the speech delivered by a medical representative to a pharmacist that he wished to be disseminated due to its effectiveness: \"1) The excipients are not the same (talc + silica) 2) no-one knows what would happen if injected 3) indeed, initial problems with generic products have arisen in Beziers\"/paragraph 375 of the decision • Sales offers aimed at saturating pharmacy aisles with Subutex® From January to August 2006, Schering-Plough finalised its plan, before the generic product had even entered the market, by offering considerable discounts to pharmacists without aiming to gain anything in return, simply for the purposes of preventing them from obtaining supplies from Arrow. The object and effect of these discounts was to saturate pharmacy aisles with boxes of Subutex®. Easy payment options were also granted (extension of payment periods, reductions) in addition to the payment options usually offered to pharmacists. With the incentive of these discounts and easy payment options, pharmacists accumulated huge stocks of the originator product to last several months (see testimony of a pharmacist, paragraph 413). Considerable impacts on the substitution rate and public accounts Even Schering-Plough's executives admitted that these practices had turned out to be very effective. For example, a Schering-Plough regional manager deemed (...) that drug addiction specialists were doing \"an excellent job with pharmacists and doctors” and pointed out that \"I believe that their actions have greatly curbed the establishment of the generic product. Every day I meet pharmacists in the field who tell me that had the drug addiction specialists not been there, they would have immediately ordered the generic product (the same is true for doctors' prescriptions). (…) I believe that given the penetration rate of the generic, they are performing exceptionally well\". By influencing both doctors and pharmacists, Schering-Plough hindered competition at two key stages of the generic substitution: at the prescription stage by significantly increasing the number of \"non-substitutable\" references (67% of prescriptions contained this reference), which limited the level of Subutex® generics; and at the dispensing stage of this medicinal product, by providing pharmacists with incentives not to substitute Subutex® when the prescription did not contain the \"non-substitutable\" reference. The substitution rate was therefore very low. The generic Buprenorphine molecule has a market share that is twice as low as the average for molecules in the same therapeutic category one year after the entry of the first generic. The Buprenorphine market constitutes a significant expense for health insurance, which reimburses an average of 77 million euro per year for this molecule. Therefore the low market penetration of the generic product has inevitably had a considerable impact on public accounts, amounting to several million euros per year. Financial penalties issued Consequently, the Autorité de la concurrence issued a 15.3 million euro fine to Schering-Plough for disparagement and unwarranted discounts granted to pharmacists. Schering-Plough and its parent company Merck & Co were also fined 414,000 euros for participating in the anticompetitive agreement. Schering-Plough did not challenge the objections issued by the Autorité, and made competition compliance commitments in order to prevent such practices in the future. It particularly undertook to monitor the planned marketing strategy prior to the arrival of generics, and to train salespeople on the unlawfulness of disparagement. These significant commitments have been made at a time when a number of the laboratory's molecules are about to be released into the public domain. The penalties imposed on Schering-Plough have therefore been reduced. Moreover, Reckitt Benckiser was also fined 318,000 euros for its participation in the anticompetitive agreement on the marketing strategy. This decision by the Autorité de la concurrence closes its second case on generic medicinal product disparagement practices. In May 2013, the Autorité previously fined Sanofi-Aventis 40.6 million euros for implementing a disparagement strategy against generics of Plavix®, one of the highest selling medicinal products in the world (see press release of 14 May 2013). The Autorité is also investigating a third case related to practices liable to constitute the denigration of a powerful analgesic (Durogesic®). > Full text of decision 13-D-21 of 18 December 2013 regarding practices implemented on the French market for high-dosage Buprenorphine sold in private practices",

The Autorité was informed that the merger had been carried out via third party On 6 May 2011, Castel Frères (hereinafter referred to as “Castel”) bought six Patriarche companies without notifying this transaction to the Autorité de la concurrence . It was only in September 2011, in the context of the examination of the acquisition of Quartier Français Spiritueux by Cofepp, that this acquisition was reported to the Investigation Services of the Autorité de la concurrence by a third party. Further to this information, the Autorité reached out to Castel and found that its turnover was above the threshold making it mandatory to have the transaction examined by the Autorité . Castel was aware of this serious offence Although the merger was finally notified and cleared by the Autorité de la concurrence (see decision 12-DCC-92 and press release of 2 July 2012), it remains true that failing to notify a merger is a serious offence as it precludes merger control. In this particular case, the infringement the Castel group is accused of is all the more unjustifiable as it is explained by a strategy whose sole purpose was the rapid completion of the merger.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence has fined the Groupe Amaury for having driven out of the market a new entrant in the sports press – Le 10Sport.com > Version française The Autorité de la concurrence has fined Les Éditions Philippe Amaury (hereinafter the Groupe Amaury) an amount of 3.5 million euro for having implemented a strategy – when Le 10Sport.com was launched on the market – aimed at closing off the market from the new entrant in order to reinforce the monopoly of L'Équipe newspaper. Launch of the sports newspapers Le 10Sport.com and Aujourd'hui Sport In September 2008, the company Le Journal du Sport, the result of a partnership between Michel Moulin, founder of Paru Vendu and NextRadioTV, run by Alain Weill, announced the launch of a 24-page colour sports daily focusing on football. Le 10Sport.com was sold at an attractive price (€0.50) and was intended for the mainstream market, directing itself mainly at men under 50. The first issue went out on sale on 3 November 2008. Two weeks after the announcement, the Amaury Group, owner of newspapers including L'Équipe, Le Parisien and Aujourd'hui en France, itself announced the launch in the coming weeks of a new sports daily entitled Aujourd'hui Sport, whose positioning (format, price, editorial line, and readership) was identical to that of Le 10Sport.com. In late October, the Amaury Group issued a statement claiming that the launch was planned for 3 November, namely the same date as the launch of Le 10Sport.com. Weighty proceedings including litigation involving the dawn raids performed by the Autorité In December 2008, Le Journal du Sport, publisher of Le 10Sport.com, filed a complaint before the Autorité de la concurrence. It accused the Amaury Group of unfair commercial practices, disparagement strategies and of putting pressure on advertisers, as well as an exclusionary practice that consisted of launching a new newspaper for the sole purpose of driving out of the market Le10Sport.com. In May 2009, officers of the Autorité de la concurrence conducted dawn raids in several premises belonging to the Groupe Amaury and seized numerous documents revealing the Group's strategy to drive out of the market Le 10Sport.com. These unannounced inspections were the subject of an appeal by the Groupe Amaury and it was not until September 2012, the date on which the Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the legality of the dawn raids, that the documents collected could be used for investigation purposes. A strategy designed to oust Le10Sport.com from the market, and with no economic underpinnings The notes, documents and tables seized show that the Groupe Amaury had created a plan, known as “Project Shanghai” that was designed to “kill Le10Sport”. The documents in the casefile show that the Group had envisaged three scenarios for challenging the launch of Le10 Sport.com. The first consisted of not reacting at all. The second – the one that was adopted – resulted in the creation of a new daily paper. The third corresponded to a reworking of L'Équipe newspaper. For each scenario, the group had created business plans assessing the costs and benefits that could be expected in terms of finance and circulation (see pages 46-48 of the decision). • An unprofitable financial sacrifice even in the long term It emerges from the casefile that the Groupe Amaury chose a response scenario (launch of a new newspaper) from among several options. This choice was never the most profitable option for the Groupe Amaury, but always the option that would do the most damage to Le 10Sport.com, whether in terms of readership or in financial terms.  This choice was an irrational one from an economic point of view for the Groupe Amaury since it generated a major financial sacrifice due to the effect of the cannibalisation of the sales of L'Equipe by the new daily.  • A daily with an ephemeral purpose The investigation shows that no sales projection performed went beyond 14 months from the launch date. When the chairman of the Group was questioned on the subject of Aujourd'hui Sport's future by the press on 7 November 2008, she indicated that it would “no doubt” be made to disappear in the event of its competitor ceasing publication. In addition, the employees of Aujourd'hui Sport were on detachment from another group subsidiary for a limited period of time or recruited on fixed-term contracts. A date for returning “to the original job” was indicated for the employees on detachment. The cessation of publication of the Aujourd'hui Sport daily in June 2009, occurring after that of Le 10Sport.com (which had become a weekly) in March 2009, thus corroborated the former's ephemeral nature. In fact, despite improving results, the publication of Aujourd'hui Sport ceased at the very moment when circulation was increasing and at time when the summer season was favourable for media expansion. Mission accomplished: restoring the L'Équipe monopoly The strategy implemented by the Groupe Amaury captured some of the 10Sport.com readership, reducing its sales and operating result, and eventually leading to cessation of activity for the daily. By achieving the goal it had set itself, the Groupe Amaury enabled its newspaper L'Équipe to regain its monopoly of the French daily sporting press. An exclusionary practice that harms both the range of products offered and the readership The way in which a company reacts when a competitor arrives on the market is legitimate if it is based on fair competition. In this case, the Groupe Amaury artificially launched a newspaper with the sole aim of protecting L'Équipe's monopoly. Consequently, the position currently occupied in the market by the Groupe Amaury is the result of this anti-competitive strategy. The adverse consequences of such an exclusionary practice are important both for the industry and for the readership. Currently, there is just one product on the market, whereas Le 10Sport.com offered an alternative by positioning itself in a market segment that had been vacant hitherto, that of low-priced sports dailies. The Autorité de la concurrence fined the Groupe Amaury an amount of 3.5 million euros. In calculating the amount of this financial penalty, the Autorité took into account the seriousness of the facts and the harm done to the economy, as well as the position occupied by the Groupe Amaury and the difficulties it is encountering. To take account of the financial difficulties in which the Group's press subsidiaries find themselves, the Autorité reduced the amount of the penalty by 60%. The Autorité has thus been able to assure itself that the Group, which also covers other activities such as the holding of sporting events (the Tour de France, Dakar Rally, etc.), would be able to afford the penalty. > For more details about the case, please consult the full text of decision 14-D-02 of 20 February 2014 concerning the practices implemented in the sports press sector > Press contact: André Piérard - Tel: +33 1 55 04 02 28 > See Decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (15tf May 2015) > See Decision of the Court of Cassation (Supreme court of appeal) - 1st March 2017",

Cegedim is leader in the medical database information market, and enjoys a dominant position. It offers both databases and management software to laboratories, whereas Euris only produces customer management software. Euris' complaint Euris accused Cegedim, among other things, of abusing its dominant position by refusing to sell its database to laboratories that were using or intending to use it with Euris management software. Cegedim refused to sell its reference database to customers using Euris software Cegedim refused to sell its OneKey database – the benchmark for the sector – to laboratories that were using software marketed by Euris, although it had agreed to sell it to laboratories that were using other competing software. Several laboratories, as well as Cegedim's management, confirmed the situation during the proceedings (see paragraphs 201ff. of the decision). Cegedim justified its refusal since it claimed to be suing Euris for counterfeiting. Euris has been hampered in its development This abusively discriminatory treatment – the existence of a lawsuit for counterfeiting not constituting justification for the implementation of anti-competitive practices - caused Euris to lose any possibility of expansion in the management software market. The laboratories that used its software or that were interested in its software solution could not access the leading database in the market and consequently were deterred from working with Euris. This practice, which was instituted in October 2007, despite the fact that Cegedim was fully aware of the illegal nature thereof, had a seriously harmful effect on Euris, which lost 70% of its customers between 2008 and 2012, and restricted the laboratories in their choice of customer management software. A 5.7 million euros fine Consequently, the Autorité has fined Cegedim 5.7 million euros, in view of the length of time the breach lasted, namely from April 2007 to April 2013, the gravity of the practice and the damage caused to the economy.  It also enjoined Cegedim to cease to discriminate between its customers according to the software they are using. > For more details about the case, consult the full text of decision 14-D-06 of 8 July 2014 > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (24th September 2015)  > See decision of the Court of Cassation/Supreme Court of Appeal (21th June 2017)",

To avoid disturbing the championship which is about to begin, the suspension will be effective at the end  of the 2014/2015 broadcasts. A new call for tenders for awarding broadcasting rights for the following seasons must be organized  by 31 January 2015 at the latest. > Version française  Following a complaint with request for urgent interim measures filed by beIN Sports, the Autorité has ordered the French Rugby national League and Canal Plus ( Société d'Edition de Canal + et Société Groupe Canal + )  to suspend the agreement concluded on January 14th, 2014 granting Canal Plus exclusive broadcasting rights for the Top 14 matches for a period of five years . The Autorité decided that this suspension should be effective from the end of the 2014/2015 season in order not to harm in a disproportionate way clubs', broadcasters and viewers' interests. Rights for the following seasons should be the subject to a new call for tenders in transparent and non discriminatory conditions. Background In December 2013, after the failure of private negotiations with Canal Plus on the upgrading of the Top 14 television broadcasting rights, the national League decided to withdraw from the contract with Canal Plus before its date of termination. Consequently, it announced the launch of a call to tender for the award of broadcasting rights for the following four seasons (2014/2015 to 2017/2018). In reaction, Canal Plus filed several law suits and, in particular, applied to the presiding judge of the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for a motion to issue an interim injunction requiring a suspension of the call to tender. The League interrupted the call to tender on 10 January 2014, without awaiting the court judgement. Then, on 14 January 2014, it granted entire and exclusive rights for five seasons (2014/2015 to 2018/2019) to Canal Plus, after negotiating a private agreement. In March 2014, beIN Sports complained about the conditions under which these rights had been granted. In the current state of the investigations, the agreement described above between the national League and the Canal Plus Group and the ways through which it was negotiated and subsequently entered into are liable to reveal that the agreement was anti-competitive . The Autorité de la concurrence considered that the Top 14 rights had become particularly attractive due to the interest in this competition manifested by subscribers and the large audiences it attracts. The level of interest gained through the broadcasting rights, comparable to those achieved by some football matches, is a manifestation of this activity. All these factors show that broadcasting the Top 14 drives up subscriptions for pay-tv stations. In this respect, rights to the championship are liable to be defined as premium rights and, for a limited period, they should be marketed under transparent and non-discriminatory conditions, in accordance with case law . The fact that in Autumn 2013, the League and Groupe Canal Plus (GCP) successively entered into private negotiations in order to extend the Canal Plus' exclusive rights, and subsequently stopped accepting bids before the deadline for bids, restarting exclusive negotiations in January 2014 resulting in an agreement assigning the entirety of the rights to Top 14 matches for an extended period (five years) to GCP, are factors liable to reveal an anti-competitive situation. GCP's competitors were thus unable to participate in the assignment of rights to the Top 14 matches and would not have had the option of access, in whole or in part, to these attractive rights for a period of five years . Emergency interim measures: neutralising the contract effects The Autorité decided to order interim measures, finding that there had been a serious and immediate attack on the pay television sector and on consumers' interests, since allocating the entirety of the rights to the top 14 for five years to GCP would have had the effect of reserving the matches in this competition to viewers able to afford to subscribe locally to a service costing 40 euros per month and denying even partial access to rebroadcasts to interested consumers who were paying a mid-range subscription of about 12 euros per month. The situation could also damage the development of beIN Sports, the only new entrant that may potentially drive competition in sports programmes on subscription television.  Consequently, and while awaiting a judgement on the substance of the case, the Autorité de la concurrence pronounced the following measures: It enjoins the GCP and the League to suspend the agreement entered into on 14 January 2014 . However, in order not to disrupt the 2014/2015 season, which starts up in mid-August, and to protect the interests of the clubs, broadcasters and viewers, the suspension will only come into force at the end of the 2014/2015 broadcasting season. The Autorité has requested the League to proceed as soon as possible and, at the latest, by 31 January 2015, with a new assignment of broadcasting rights for the 2015/2016 and following seasons. This assignment should be performed at the end of a transparent and non-discriminatory competition procedure and for a length of time that is not disproportionately long.    The Autorité has enjoined GCP to cease any communication, whether external or directed at its subscribers, covering the exclusive award of rights to the Top 14 matches for the next five seasons ending in the 2018/2019 season. > Decision 14-MC-01 of 30 July 2014 relative to a request for interim measures filed by beIN Sports France in the pay-TV sector > See Decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (9th November 2014) > See Order the Court of Cassation (9th April 2015) Press contact: Ingalill d'Armaillé:  + 33 1 55 04 01 82 Mel",

Between December 2007 and December 2009, SNYL disseminated statements bringing discredit on the sanitary quality of Malo products, in particular using questionable results of bacteriological analyses and claiming irregularities in the use-by dates displayed on the products. Referral to the Autorité The Autorité opened ex officio proceedings and investigated the practices implemented by SNYL in Guadeloupe and Martinique following information passed on by the French Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF). The companies concerned SNYL is a Martinique company that in particular produces yoghurts, milk-based desserts and crèmes fraîches sold under the Caresse antillaise brand name or on behalf of the Yoplait brand. SNYL is the leader on the French West Indian market, with around 65% market share. Some of the manufacturers of dairy products sold in the French West Indies are local producers, such as the Société Antillaise de Production de Yaourts (SAPY) and the Société Guadeloupéenne de Production de Yaourts (SGPY) (Danone brand). Other manufacturers such as La Laiterie de Saint Malo or Yaourt Savoie export their products from mainland France. Questioning the quality of La Laiterie de Saint-Malo products Targeted bacteriological analyses SNYL had bacteriological tests carried out on Malo yoghurts and fromage frais, which concluded that they were not fresh. However these tests applied the criteria relating to yoghurts to fromages blancs – while the regulations establish different analysis criteria for the two types of products – which led to the conclusion that the products did not comply with the regulations. Casting doubt on the freshness of the products sold in the French West Indies SNYL has likewise called into question the practice of the double use-by date (referred to as “DLC” in French) applied by Laiterie de Saint-Malo to its dairy products. Until 2013 , there was no regulation prohibiting manufacturers from offering two DLC dates, depending on the intended destination of the products sold (mainland France or overseas territories). Even though this practice was used by other suppliers, only Laiterie de Saint-Malo was targeted by SNYL. Widespread dissemination In order to reach a maximum number of distributors, SNYL disseminated its statements to the sector's trade association– obtaining Laiterie de Saint-Malo's exclusion – and directly to distributors. The delisting of Saint Malo products at several points of sale The information disseminated by SNYL had even greater resonance given that food-safety matters are of an extremely sensitive nature. Professionals are bound by a performance obligation and certain distributors were sensitive to the rumours and insinuations made in relation to Malo products. To be on the safe side, they decided to delist them in order to protect consumer health, and by extension, their own image. Thus the 3H group (Hoio) for 16 months – from 2008 to 2009 – suspended sales of the full Malo range (yoghurts and fromage frais) from its shops in Martinique. This concerned the two hypermarkets Géant Batelière in Schœlcher and Géant Océanis in Le Robert and five Casino supermarkets (François, Lorrain, Ducos, Lamentin and Fort de France). In December 2009 the Bernard Hayot Group (GBH) likewise withdrew Malo fromage frais from sale in three Carrefour stores located in Ducos and Dillon in Martinique and Destrellan in Guadeloupe. Laiterie de Saint-Malo sales were therefore limited and customers at these outlets deprived of a wider choice. The fine: 1,670,000 euros The dissemination of misleading and disparaging statements by a dominant operator to the detriment of one of its competitors is a serious practice under competition regulations. The Autorité de la concurrence therefore imposed a fine of 1,670,000 euros on SNYL and its parent companies Socrema and Antilles Glaces.  In calculating this amount, the Autorité took into account the duration of the offence (December 2007/December 2009), the serious nature of the practice and the significance of the damage done to the economy. Subsequent to Law 2013-453 of 3 June 2013, this double DLC practice was banned. > For more details on this case, consult the full text of decision 14-D-08 of 24 July 2014 regarding practices implemented in the sector for the sale of fresh dairy products in the French West Indies > Press contact: Anne-Elisabeth Akrasi/Tel: +33 1 55 04 01 46 Email > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal of 24 September 2015 > See decision of the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court of Appeal) / 8th June 2017",

The Agreement between Bouygues Telecom and SFR On 31 January 2014, Bouygues Telecom and SFR entered into a network sharing agreement. The agreement sets out the deployment of a shared mobile network of 11,500 sites over a mutualised area covering 57% of the population. The mutualised area, which does not include the most densely populated areas, is split into two, with SFR and Bouygues Telecom taking responsibility for deployment respectively to the region. Figure 17 - A simplified map of the zones operated by SFR (in red) and Bouygues Telecom (in blue), made public by the parties in February 2014. Zones in grey are excluded from the project. The agreement also sets out a temporary 4G roaming service provided by Bouygues Telecom to SFR for a small part of the mutualised area, in order to avoid deploying temporary equipments that would have to be dismantled and replaced by the target network.

The administration pays for military relocation removals The relocation of military personnel is governed by regulatory provisions that require the latter to provide the administration with at least two competing quotes for the purpose of the repayment of all or part of removals linked to a unit transfer. Specifically, the military contacts the removal company, pays the agreed price but is not in the end responsible for covering the cost of the relocation. Companies avoided competing with each other by regularly producing cover quotes, to the detriment of the public accounts The probe established that in many cases the companies were not competing with each other and in fact were sharing customers. They cooperated to submit bogus quotes (quotes setting out deliberately inflated amounts), so that one of them would definitely secure the business for the removals of the relocating military in question. The Autorité deemed these practices to be serious because their object and effect was to create an artificial distribution of the market between the removal companies and to prevent prices being set by the free play of competition. The fines imposed These practices were all the more regrettable given that similar practices had already been sanctioned in this sector and the companies involved in this case could not be unaware of the prohibited and serious nature of such infringements (see in particular decisions 09-D-19 of 10 June 2009 , 07-D-48 of 18 December 2007 , 02-D-62 of 27 September 2002 , 01-D-63 of 9 October 2001 and 99-D-50 of 13 July1999 ). Three companies, AGS Martinique (and its parent company Mobilitas), Martinique Déménagements and SMDTE, of the six present in this sector in Martinique, were fined a total sum of 237,840 euros. The Autorité imposed these fines on the basis of the serious nature of the behaviour in question, the damage caused to the economy, the individual situation of the companies, and the fact that three companies did not challenge the charges.  The company Martinique Déménagements commitmented to set up a compliance programme. > Decision 14-D-16 of the 18 November 2014 on the practices implemented in the military personnel relocation removals sector in Martinique Press contact: Coralie Anadon/ Tel: 01 55 04 00 83 / Mel > See decision of the cour d'appel de Paris (19th May 2016) > This judgement was appealed before the French Supreme Court ( ).",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision whereby it fines home care and personal care manufacturers for having implemented concerted practices. Between 2003 and 2006, on both markets, they coordinated their commercial policy towards supermarkets, and in particular their price increases. These two fines rank among the most significant fines pronounced by the Autorité de la concurrence , until now. > See information sheet 1 : the most important fines issued by the Autorité (French version) The first infringement occurred in the market for home care products . Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire participated at varying extents. They are fined a total of €345,2 millions . \t\t\t\t The second infringement occurred in the market for personal care products . Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oréal, Beiersdorf and Vania participated at varying extents. They are fined a total of €605,9 millions . A case originated from the leniency programme The Autorité de la concurrence was informed of the existence of these concerted practices by SC Johnson, Colgate-Palmolive and Henkel which successively applied to benefit from the leniency procedure. The leniency procedure allows a company which informs the Autorité de la concurrence of anticompetitive practices in which it takes or took part, to benefit from a full or partial immunity from fines, under certain conditions in particular on the basis of the rank of arrival of its leniency application, the ‘added value' of the information given as well as its full cooperation with the Autorité to establish the existence of the infringement ( more about the leniency procedure - in French). > See information sheet 2 : the leniency programme and the former cases (French version) Arrival rank for each of the concerted practices :   Rank Home care products Personal care products  The products concerned Home care products > The full list of the products concerned is available in the decision (see pp. 229 and 230)  Personal care products The market is characterized by the presence of a limited number of global players. The top 8 players in the market represent over 70 % of the overall industry turnover, the first three totalling approximately 43 % of the market (of which more than 28% on average for the group leader L'Oréal). \t\t\tThe products concerned are for instance : shower gels (Sanex, Petit Marseillais, Mont St Michel, etc), shampoos and hair-conditioners (Elsève, Fructis, Jacques Dessange, Dop, Head&Shoulders, etc.), toothpaste (Signal, Colgate, Tonigencyl, etc.) and oral care products, deodorants, shaving foams, blades and razors, depilatories, facial care, body care, feminine personal care products, solar products, etc. > The full list of the products concerned is available in the decision (see pp. 233 and 234) Raids during lunchtime at \"Le Royal Villiers \" restaurant in Paris Thanks to information disclosed by the first leniency applicants, raids were carried out in France in February and July 2006. They allowed to gather many evidence (minutes of meetings, agendas, memos, notes taken during meetings, booking vouchers, etc.). The very first raid even occurred during a lunch organised in a Parisian restaurant called “le Royal Villiers”. Some of the players (Colgate-Palmolive , SC Johnson, Henkel, Bolton Solitaire and Sara Lee) were caught in act.  Secrete “clubs” on pricing policies The legal framework At the time of the practices, commercial relationships between suppliers and distributors were governed by the \"Galland\" Law, which in fact had led to a real \" inflationary spiral \" by restricting competition between market players. To remedy these effects and obtain cheaper prices for consumers, public authorities then sought to modify this framework on three occasions during the period 2003-2005 (Dutreil circular of 16 May 2003, Commitment for a sustainable reduction of consumer prices of 17 June 2004 - Dutreil law of 2 August 2005). Confronted with this new legal context, the supermarket suppliers for home and personal care products coordinated their commercial policy towards their distributors, to avoid any increase of competition between them.  > See information sheet 3 about the changes in the legal Framework The « Team » and « Friends » clubs The concerted practices were particularly sophisticated. They led to convergence in behaviours concerning the main elements of commercial negotiations between all main suppliers for home care and personal care products. To discuss about each sector, they met regularly and secretly to coordinate their commercial policies and discuss their pricing policies. Undertakings coordinated during meetings that took place in different “clubs” called \"Team \" or \"Friends\", where commercial managers or sales managers met. The meetings took place in restaurants, in addition, they exchanged also correspondence at their private homes. These exchanges were supplemented by bilateral or multilateral contacts, including phone calls, which allowed companies to strengthen the exchanges initiated within the clubs. Information sharing was aiming at price convergence The collusive practices were intended to bring together the positions held by suppliers during the commercial negotiations with distributors . They allowed suppliers to better adapt their proposals, with the assurance that they would never find themselves disadvantaged and isolated during the business negotiations vis-à-vis the distributors/buyers. Information was thus shared before the negotiations with the distributors, each supplier disclosing/revealing its strategy concerning price increases and remuneration paid for the commercial cooperation services. > Example of handwritten notes taken during one of these meetings by a Henkel commercial manager.  Henkel commented as follows:  \"(...) The participants shared information on the future overall price increases, as the table shows: The first column \"how much\" indicates in percentage the overall price increases;  The second column \" when \" indicates the effective date for the increase ;  The third \"\" column smoothing indicates the period during which retailers can still purchase the products at the previous price;  The fourth column indicates the date taken into account to actually calculate price increase index mentioned in the fifth column . (...) \"(Paragraph 494 of the decision)   In the personal care sector, these meetings also allowed participants to develop a common bargaining strategy and to prepare together arguments to be developed with distributors to justify the price increases . These practices were accompanied with information sharing on very recent data on negotiation progress, turnovers, terms and conditions. These elements aimed at controlling if members of the collusion didn't deviate from the discussed strategy. Artificially high prices The concerted practices distorted negotiations with distributors to the benefit of suppliers. They allowed to maintain artificially high selling prices to retailers, which were then passed on prices paid by end consumers .  > For example, during the 2006 commercial negotiations, most of the participants were able to pass high price increases, in the range of 4 to 6% , close to the level originally announced by one of the participants.  > The exceptional nature of the increases passed by suppliers provoked strong reactions from distributors. In an article in the newspaper Le Monde, dated 5 December 2005, Jose Luis Duran, CEO of Carrefour (a major French retailing network), said: \" price increases of 4 to 6% \" (...) have been proposed to us\". In Spain and Italy however, we notice that the increase proposed amount 1% , in Belgium and Greece between 2 and 2.5%. Yet the reasons for prices increases - inflation, oil prices , raw material costs and wages - are not very different from one country to another \" (...) \" The products that undergo severe increases drive generally high consumer fidelity. I can not get them out of the shelves \"(paragraph 560 of the decision).  Fines These practices are serious and harmed the economy The practices were particularly serious, given not only to their secrete character but also because of their nature : the concerted practices aimed at distorting then main components of commercial negotiations, especially price evolutions. The Autorité also pointed out that these infringements harmed the economy. They covered the whole and took place in markets which count a very small number of players offering sometimes “unavoidable” products. These practices also had an important impact on consumers. The level of the fines is linked to the important size of the concerned markets (around 4.7 billion euros for home care products and 7 billion for personal care products). However, sales of laundry detergents already targeted in a previous decision of the Autorité have been deducted from the value of sales used as basis for the calculation of the fine. In 2011, it fined four manufacturers of detergents (Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Henkel and Colgate Palmolive) a total amount of 367.9 million euros for price fixing (see Decision 11-D-17 of 8 December 2011 on practices implemented in the laundry sector in France, fully confirmed by a final Paris court of appeal ruling dated January 30, 2014). The Autorité also adapted the level of fines to take into account the degree of the undertakings' individual participation to the practices and also specific elements linked to their behavior and their individual situation. The Autorité considered that Colgate-Palmolive played a leading role in both infringements and that many of the condemned undertakings belonged to groups with prominent sizes, economic power and global resources.  Leniency The company SC Johnson has received full immunity (rank 1) under the terms of the leniency programme regarding its participation to the concerted practices concerning home care products . Similarly, Colgate-Palmolive has been completely released from fine for its participation to the concerted practices in the personal care products market. It has been exempted up to 50 % for its participation to the infringement on the market for home care products (rank 2). Henkel also benefited from a 30% exemption (rank 2) under leniency for its participation in the on the personal care market and 25% (rank 3) for its behaviour on the home care market. Negotiated settlement procedure Companies belonging to Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and Beiersdorf have not challenged the facts; they have proposed compliance commitments for the future. They benefited therefore from an additional reduction from 16 to 18% in the fine.

TDF owns the vast majority of the infrastructures necessary for terrestrial Hertzian broadcasting by television channels and the use of hosting on its sites is essential to alternative operators. On ARCEP's request, the Autorité issued an opinion in 2009 in which it held that TDF's position on the upstream wholesale market of Hertzian broadcasting offers had become stronger since 2006 and that competition in this market was poor due to the small size of alternative operators and the dependence of channels on the incumbent operator's broadcasting infrastructures ( opinion 09-A-09 / See press release ).  Strengthening its regulatory framework, ARCEP then imposed a requirement for TDF to publish reference offers (RO) specifying the technical and pricing conditions of regulated offers for hosting and access to the antenna system. The aim of this publication was to ensure a level economic playing field for new entrants by giving them good visibility of the technical and pricing conditions proposed by TDF . The Autorité de la concurrence's decision By delaying, without due cause, the publication of this reference offer, TDF abused its dominant position. Competition on the calls for tender was indeed distorted as a result of the asymmetry of information that TDF created between itself and its competitors. TDF's conduct closed the overseas territories to competition, both in terms of the provision of broadcast services and access to infrastructures throughout the term of the broadcasting contracts (five years).  Based on its assessment of the gravity of the facts and the extent of the damage to the economy, the Autorité fines TDF a total of 3.5 million euros. Moreover, noting that TDF had already been fined for similar practices ( decision 99-D-14 of 23 February 1999), the Autorité factored in that it was a repeat offence. In the light of this, the amount of the fine was increased by 20%.  > Full text of the decision 15-D-01 of 5 February 2015 on practices implemented in the sector of terrestrial Hertzian television broadcasting overseas Press contact: Rebecca Hébert - Tel. 00 33 (0)1 55 04 01 81 - Email > See decision of the cour d'appel de Paris (15th September 2016) > See decision of the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court of Appeal) - 30 May 2018",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines the economic interest group (GIE) Les Indés Radios  for failure to comply with several commitments made during a previous procedure. > Version française  The Autorité de la concurrence has fined the economic interest group Les Indés Radios 300,000 euros for failure to comply with the competition commitments that it had itself made in 2006. These commitments, which were made mandatory by Decision 06-D-29 (see press release ), were aimed at ensuring the transparency, objectivity and predictability of membership conditions as well as the conditions to stay in or leave the group. The Autorité has also obliged the GIE to comply with the commitments in the future, subject to a €500 daily fine. History of the case The GIE's purpose lies in aggregating local radio audiences in order to provide an offer of bulk advertising spaces allowing them to access the market for national advertisement. Canal 9, which notably operates the radio station Chante France, had submitted a complaint to the Conseil de la concurrence with regard to discriminatory procedures for joining the group. The effect of these procedures was to prevent Chante France from having access to the market for national advertisement, a necessary source of income for its financial balance. During the investigation, it became apparent that membership conditions as well as conditions for staying in or leaving the GIE were neither objective nor transparent and were lacking any clear definition. Moreover, they could prevent certain local radio stations from accessing the market for national advertisement. The Conseil found that there was no alternative solution equivalent to the membership of the GIE for an independent local radio station wishing to enter the market for national advertisement. On this basis it held that the agreement between group members to fix conditions to be able to join or stay in the GIE was likely to be qualified as anticompetitive insofar as these conditions could be aimed at, or result in, the prevention, under discriminatory conditions, of access by certain local radio stations to the market for national advertisement. The GIE then made commitments aimed at reforming its internal rules as well as the set of documents sent to radio stations applying for membership. These reforms would include specifying the conditions of eligibility for membership of the group, improving transparency of admission procedures and putting into place a transparent and contradictory exclusion procedure. The GIE also made the commitment that any subsequent changes to these documents would respect these principles. Failure to comply with commitments Following ex officio proceedings, the Autorité found several amendments to the documents in question, subsequent to the 2006 decision. Some of the amendments regarding membership conditions were such as to limit the transparency and predictability of the conditions under which applicant radio stations can join the group. It was likewise apparent that the contradictory procedure in the event of the exclusion of a radio station had not been systematically carried out. In addition, the GIE had established the possibility of excluding a radio station in the event of failure to submit certain information linked to its capital or management bodies, when only the application of a penalty was envisaged in the commitments.  Moreover, several highlighted amendments contravened the objectives of the commitments made by the GIE, such as the increase in the notice period to be respected by a radio station leaving the group, making it more difficult for this radio station to consider the possibility of a competing offer. Consequently, the Autorité imposed a €300,000 fine on the GIE and ordered it to comply with its commitments subject to a €500 daily fine, from the expiry of a four-month period starting from the date of notification of the decision . > For further details on this matter, see full text of decision 15-D-02 dated 26 February 2015 concerning the compliance of the GIE \"Les Indépendants\" with the commitments made in Conseil de la concurrence decision 06-D-29 of 6 October 2006 > Press contact: Rebecca Hébert / Tel.: +33(0)1 55 04 01 81 / Email > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th October 2016) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (26th September 2018)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines €192.7 million an anticompetitive agreement on dairy products sold under retailers' own-brand labels > Version française  The Autorité issues today a decision in which it finds the following producers guilty of entering into an anticompetitive agreement: Yoplait, Senagral (Senoble), Lactalis, Novandie (Andros Group), Les Maîtres Laitiers du Contentin, Laïta, Alsace Lait, Laiterie de Saint Malo, Yeo Frais (3A group) and Laiteries H. Triballat (Rians). The penalised practices took place from 2006 to 2012 with a variable duration depending on the companies. Yoplait, as the first leniency applicant, was fully exempted from penalties. The company thus avoids a €44.7 million fine. Senagral, which faced an initial €101.3 million fine, benefited from a reduced sanction as ‘type 2' leniency applicant. Total fines: €192.7 million A cartel dismantled as a result of the leniency procedure In August 2011 and February 2012, the Autorité de la concurrence was successively informed of the practices by General Mills-Yoplait (hereinafter Yoplait) and by Senoble-Senagral (hereinafter Senagral). Each company in turn applied for leniency. Senegral's second rank application was made a few days after dawn raids had taken place. The leniency procedure allows undertakings that participate or have participated in a cartel to reveal the existence thereof to the Autorité. As a result, under certain conditions, they may benefit from total or partial exoneration from a fine, depending on the order in which they have approached the Autorité, their cooperation in the investigation and the added value of the facts of which they were able to inform the Autorité. This is the 9th leniency case with which the Autorité has dealt to date. Operation of the cartel Many elements of the case indicate that the undertakings which are today receiving fines held meetings and had numerous telephone conversations aimed at price-fixing and allocating volumes between themselves in the own-brand dairy products sector. Supermarkets and hypermarkets are the major outlet for manufacturers of fresh dairy products: 92% of retail sales of yoghurts, fromages frais, crèmes fraîches and milk-based desserts were made in food superstores for a sum of around 5 billion euros in 2013. Steering meetings and telephone discussions The cartel's centre of gravity consisted of the sector's four leaders: Yoplait, Novandie, Lactalis and Senoble. The meetings would generally take place in hotels reserved by each participant in turn. The location changed each time in order to ensure discretion. The Director General of Novandie also stated during the investigation that some meetings had taken place in or close to his Parisian apartment: '\"The apartment (...) in the 6th arrondissement belongs to my family. We would generally meet in a cafe such as \"Le chien qui fume\" in Boulevard du Montparnasse. The Lactalis representatives (...) came to my apartment a few times to continue the conversation and smoke a cigarette. \" Telephone conversations took place in particular via secret mobile phones used exclusively for the cartel. The lines were not officially registered with their users and their names did not appear on the bills. For instance, Senoble's representative had a telephone registered in his companion's name. The Yoplait representative kept a \"secret file\" on the cartel. He used it to record all the decisions taken during these conversations. Yoplait submitted this file to the Autorité de la concurrence in support of its declarations, at the time when it made its application for leniency. Price cartel The competitors informed each other of any price rises made and reached agreement on any rises they wanted to announce to distributors as well as the arguments to justify them. Notes taken during the meeting of 4 July 2007 state that: \"The general price rise should take effect from 1 October 2007, along the following lines: +3% on desserts, +4% on yoghurts and +5% on fromages frais and crème fraîche\". Yoplait first explained: \"During this meeting, the participants went round the table to focus, client by client, on the letters to be sent out by each supplier about the price rises.\" \"The participants reached agreement on the origin of the cost increases so the increase could be justified to their clients\" [...] \"increase in milk and cheese\", \"agreement on the major points […] milk +1.5% per quarter => 3%\", \"sugar drop in subsidies + hot weather\", \"increase in prices of fruit + hot weather\" \"2011 was an active year for the cartel in terms of coordinating price rises. Indeed, two increases were introduced one after the other, in the spring of 2011 then during the summer of 2011, by the own-brand fresh milk-product producers (.../...). After a detailed round table discussion about the statement of increases for the year 2010 just gone, the participants agreed on the principles for the first 2011 increase. (…) The discussion held on the basis of this document led to the decision to inform clients of an 8% rise with the aim of obtaining an actual increase of 6% and an average cumulative increase over 2010/2011 of around 10%.\" (Yoplait's Declaration). Volume sharing agreement The undertakings also reached non-aggression pacts consisting of distributing volumes and freezing their positions in relation to each other. This was done particularly by distorting submissions in response to tenders launched by the major retailers.  In its declaration, Yoplait described the mechanisms established for the offsetting of volumes as follows:   \"If one of the members of the cartel looses volumes and was not informed of it directly by its competitor who took them, it is informed by the client. The aggrieved competitor would then contact the operator who had taken the volumes from it. The volumes lost are owed but compensation is not necessarily made immediately. A debt is then created which must be settled by the participant who has won the volumes from its competitor. This debt is settled with the creditor as soon as an opportunity exists or arises (for example, a new call for tender in which the debtor will give priority to its creditor). […] Each participant in the cartel knows what it owes, what it is owed and who owes it at any given moment\". In total, 18 tender procedures were distorted by the use of these practices. Serious anticompetitive practices that distorted the operation of the market over several years The scope of the cartel was very broad since it covered the whole territory. In addition, the manufacturers of retail own-brand labels fresh milk products involved represent more than 90% of the market in question. Its secretive nature and sophisticated modus operandi (regular change in meeting place, dedicated mobile phones, meetings at the private home of one of the participants, etc.) aggravate the practices carried out. Furthermore, the products involved are everyday products which consumers buy for reasons of price and for which consumers are relatively captive. The fines were proportional to the seriousness of the events, and the extent of the loss caused to the economy. Thereafter they were tailored on the basis of the set of circumstances of the undertakings' individual situations.  Consequently, the fact that Lactalis belongs to a large group was taken into account (25% increase in the fine). Likewise, the financial difficulties of Senagral (formerly Senoble) and Novandie were taken into account and the fine decreased. This was also the case with SME Alsace Lait, given its small size and economic fragility.  On the grounds of mitigating circumstances, the Autorité granted Novandie a reduction in its fine for having adopted competitive behaviour for one year. This 'maverick' behaviour resulted in a disruption of the cartel's operation. Finally, the undertakings in question, with the exception of Laiterie de Saint Malo, did not contest the facts and consequently had their fines reduced as a result of the settlement procedure. > For more details on this case, consult the full text of decision 15-D-03 of the 11 March 2015 on practices implemented in the fresh dairy products sector > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (23 May 2017) > This decision was submitted before the Cour de cassation (Supreme court of appeal)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines 3 millers for anticompetitive agreements on increases in the price of flour sold to craft bakeries. > Version française  The Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision whereby it fines Axiane meunerie, Minoteries Cantin and Grands Moulins de Strasbourg a total of 1.1 million euros for having reached anti-competitive agreements on the price of flour sold to bakers in 2007 . The details of the fines imposed are as follows: The Autorité has not fined numerous other mills on the grounds of lack of evidence of their participation in the anticompetitive agreement. The millers met to discuss prices The evidence seized during the dawn raids carried out as part of the packaged flour investigation showed that another agreement had also been established in the sector of flour sold to craft bakeries. Examination of the evidence indicated that on 11 June 2007, representatives of the mills in question held a meeting, in the specific context of the sharp increase in wheat prices of the year 2007, to decide on a target for price increases in flour sold to craft bakeries. Prohibited practices but on a limited scale The Autorité recalls that horizontal agreements between competitors are prohibited. In the case in question, these three millers, by agreeing on similar price increases, distorted normal competition to the detriment of the bakers. However, in particular given the limited market share of the millers concerned (8% in volume at the time in question) and the short duration of the agreement (6 months), the scope of the damage is limited. Consequently, the Autorité de la concurrence has ordered moderate fines totalling 1,138,000 euros. It has furthermore reduced Axiane meunerie's fine in view of the financial difficulties that the company is currently undergoing. This case results from a separate investigation arising from the proceedings on packaged flour which was the subject of a judgement by the Autorité in 2012 ( see press release of 13 March 2012 ) and which was brought to the Autorité's attention following a leniency application. > For more details on this case, consult the full text of decision 15-D-04 of 26 March 2015 on practices in the craft bakery sector.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence, in coordination with the European Commission and the Italian and Swedish authorities, has obtained particularly extensive commitments from Booking.com aiming to boost competition between online booking  platforms and give hotels more freedom in commercial and pricing matters. These commitments, undertaken for 5 years, will come into force from 1 July 2015  with an intermediary assessment planned for late 2016. > Version française  In brief Within the scope of a procedure initiated before the Autorité de la concurrence by the main French hotel unions and the Accor group, Booking.com commits to change its commercial practices. Booking.com indeed commits to amend the price parity clause and remove any clause imposing parity obligations in terms of the availability of rooms or commercial conditions. This is not only in relation to competing platforms but also hotels' direct offline channels as well as some of their online channels . Hotels may consequently freely apply lower prices and/or better commercial conditions on platforms in competition with Booking.com and allocate them larger quotas of rooms. In particular, they may also offer prices at a lower rate than those displayed on the Booking.com website via their offline sales channels (on-site bookings, by telephone, fax, email, instant messaging, physical sales outlets of travel agencies, etc.) as long as these prices are not published on the hotel's website. They may also offer prices at a lower rate than those displayed on the Booking.com website to customers who are members of loyalty programmes . In addition, hotels may reserve a number of rooms greater than the number of rooms allocated to Booking.com to their direct sales channel (online or offline). These commitments are undertaken for 5 years and come into force from 1 July 2015. These measures constitute a balanced package that meets the aims sought by the Autorité:       - they should provide an impetus to competition between Booking.com and competing OTAs, allowing the commissions levied on the hotels to fall;       - they also give hotels some countervailing power by considerably improving their commercial and pricing freedom;        - they maintain at the same time the OTAs' (Online travel agents) economic model which provides consumers with powerful research and comparison services. The Autorité de la concurrence will carry out an assessment with the participation of both parties on the effectiveness of the commitments by January 1st 2017 at the latest. This procedure takes place within the European context of enhanced cooperation. France, Sweden and Italy have worked together, in close coordination with the European Commission, to obtain similar commitments from Booking.com in these three countries. Bruno Lasserre, President of the Autorité de la concurrence, Giovanni Pitruzzella, President of the Italian competition authority and Dan Sjöblom, Director General of the Swedish competition authority have stated the following: « With coordination from the European Commission, our three authorities have collaborated in an unprecedented way in our investigations into online hotel reservation platforms. Today, we can announce that we have decided to approve commitments offered to us by the market leader, Booking.com. The commitments have been significantly improved following a market test. These new commitments limit Booking.com's use of price parity as part of its commission-based business model and substantially increase the hotels' margin for maneuver. The commitments offered by Booking.com strike the right balance for consumers in France, Italy and Sweden, restoring competition while at the same time preserving user-friendly free search and comparison services and encouraging the burgeoning digital economy ». Several other national competition authorities in Europe have initiated procedures in relation to the same practices. They have therefore followed with great interest the developments of such enhanced cooperation and will now consider the possibility to extend these commitments to their own market. Besides, the Autorité is continuing to investigate the Expedia and HRS platforms, also covered by the complaints lodged by the hotels, as well as the request for an opinion from the Minister of the Economy.         70% of rooms booked via the internet are made through online booking platforms The sale of nights via internet has experienced a remarkable increase over the last decade. Today, almost all hotel guests (93% ) use the internet to find a hotel, although the vast majority of reservations are made offline (66% ). Online booking platforms (Booking.com, Expedia, HRS being the three main sites for French hotel bookings) serve as intermediaries between clients (tourists, business travellers) and hotels. The development of online booking platforms constitutes remarkable progress for consumers as it enables them to research, compare and book hotels on the same site, benefiting from information available in their own language, as well as from comments by other customers and photographs. This has increased competition between hotels while enabling them to achieve visibility throughout the world, thus enabling them to dispense with the traditional tourist guides and travel agencies. On the other hand, these platforms, and especially Booking.com, deduct commission from the hotelier that is proportional to the cost of the reservation . In Europe, these represent the main channel for online bookings, accounting for about 70% of online hotel bookings, the remaining 30% being bookings made directly from hotel websites. For a hotel, especially in France, the world's leading tourist destination, it is essential to be present on these platforms: they ensure great visibility and are widely used by Internet users all over the world. Booking.com occupies a key position vis-à-vis French hoteliers. It holds the leadership position, with more than two thirds of the market of online bookings made on the platforms. Out of the 17,000 French hotels, a vast majority is referenced on its website. Hotel unions and the Accor group have denounced the parity clauses with which hotels are obliged to comply in order to be referenced on Booking.com Hotel unions and the Accor group have accused the online hotel booking platforms - and Booking.com in particular - of subjecting hotels to compliance with so-called “parity” clauses. Under these clauses, online platforms require hotels to make at least as favourable offers of room prices, number of nights stayed and other conditions (booking conditions, whether or not breakfast is included, etc.) as those offered on competing platforms as well as through other distribution channels (on and off line), including the hotel's own distribution channels (website, telephone, e-mail, the hotel reservation desk, etc.). According to the trade unions, hotels are thus prevented from putting the booking platforms in competition with one another. Since these clauses are applied on all platforms, hotels find themselves forced to agree to identical prices per night, availability and conditions for the offer of rooms, from whence the term \"parity clauses\". As an example, if a hotel offers a room at €100 a night on Booking.com, it will be forced to offer a night at the same price on the Expedia and HRS sites. The competition concerns: sluggish competition between online platforms and risk of foreclosure of new entrants The implementation of parity clauses may have anti-competitive effects. It is likely to reduce competition between Booking.com and its competing platforms . Indeed, whatever the level of the commission rate charged by Booking.com, hotels are obliged to grant it room rates, number of rooms available for booking and sales conditions that are as favourable as those granted to competing platforms. Furthermore, parity clauses may lead to the foreclosure of smaller platforms or those that have just entered the online booking market . Even when lower commission rates are offered which are more attractive to hotels, these platforms cannot differentiate on price and offer customers cheaper room rates. THE MAIN COMMITMENTS MADE BY BOOKING Booking.com has substantially supplemented its initial commitment proposal in response to the main concerns raised during the market test and requests from the Autorité de la concurrence (the points marked in red are the improvements made). 1) The removal of any price parity obligation with regard to other OTAs Hotels may henceforth offer lower prices than those displayed on Booking.com via other online booking platforms. As a result, they will be able to adapt their prices in line with quality of services and/or level of commission rates provided by the booking platforms. Other platforms may display these lower prices on their own websites, comparison sites and search engines. 2) The removal of the price parity clause in relation to offline hotel channels and loyalty programmes Hotels may propose lower prices than those available on Booking.com via their own direct offline channels (telephone, hotel reception, bilateral emails, travel agencies). However, these prices offered offline must not be published or marketed online to the public in general, namely on the internet (hotel website, comparison sites and search engines) or by means of mobile phone apps. Nonetheless, hotels may, for example, on the pages accessible to the public on their website, display qualitative information regarding the prices offered via their offline channels, such as \"attractive prices\", \"good prices\", etc. Furthermore, hotels will be allowed to send emails and SMS messages to consumers informing them of the prices offered via their offline channels. Hotels will also be able to offer lower prices than those available on the Booking.com online site to clients who belong to a loyalty programme. 3) The removal of the obligations regarding parity of conditions  Hotels will also be completely free to offer consumers more favourable conditions than those offered on Booking.com via other platforms and via their own offline channels. This notably concerns breakfast or any other service (e.g. gym, spa, internet access, etc.) as well as booking conditions (e.g. cancellation). 4) The complete removal of any parity obligation in relation to availability Hotels will be entirely free to manage their capacity and their availability in terms of rooms. They may allocate Booking.com a number of rooms that is less than that offered to other online platforms and/or via their own channels . Hotels will from now on have a certain leeway to negotiate with Booking.com insofar as they may favour online reservation platforms that offer them a better service and/or a lower commission rate by offering them a greater number of rooms. They may also reserve the sale of a certain number of rooms to their direct channels, in particular during the tourist season, when the hotel has no difficulty in filling the rooms. Furthermore, Booking.com commits, when it is posting information on availability or number of rooms available for booking at an accommodation, to display the remark \"on this/our site\". This will avoid the possibility of consumers believing that no other room is available via any channel. 5) The possibility that hotels may contact prior customers Booking.com commits not to prohibit hotels from making contact with prior customers, namely customers who have already stayed at the accommodation at least once, whatever the means of booking used for the previous stay, including via Booking. The concept of prior customer is defined in the broadest sense since customers who have stayed at one property that is part of a hotel chain or a community of hotels that have pooled their reservation services are deemed to be prior customers of all the accommodation in this chain of hotels or community of hotels. 6) Timetable for implementation and intermediary assessment clause Booking.com commits to implement the commitments by 1 July 2015 at the latest in order to allow implementation as from the start of the approaching summer tourist season, for a duration of 5 years . Moreover, Booking.com commits to submit a report to the Autorité de la concurrence on the implementation of the commitments with a view to drawing up an assessment by both parties on the effectiveness of the commitments made. This report should be duly submitted at the earliest on 1 July 2016 and at the latest on 1 October 2016 . This report drawn up by Booking.com will be sent to the parties who made the referral. These parties may make observations on the report and produce their own quantitative and qualitative data in relation to the consequences of the implementation of these commitments. An adversarial hearing to which Booking.com and the parties who made the referral will be called will be organised for 1 January 2017 at the latest. This assessment led by the Autorité de la concurrence should make it possible to establish whether the implemented commitments have allowed competition to be boosted significantly and in particular whether they led to a fostered competition between platforms, to a reduction in commission levels and a broadening of competitive offers.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence will not order interim measures against Google, but will continue to review the merits of the case on the basis of the complaint filed by an advertiser whose Adwords account was suspended. > Version française  The complaint filed by Gibmedia Gibmedia operates paid information websites that include weather forecasts, business data and telephone information. The company claims that in January 2015, Google suspended without notice the AdWords account that it used to display advertisements on its websites info-meteo.fr, pages-annuaire.net, annuaires-inverse.net and info-societe.com. According to the complainant, the procedure followed by Google as well as the grounds for the suspension were not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory. In parallel to its complaint on the merits of the case, Gibmedia has requested interim measures. The online advertising market AdWords, Google's online advertising service, allows advertisers' advertisements to appear to the right, above or below the results of a natural search, depending on the keywords entered by internet users. Given the market share held by Google, the search engine currently appears to still dominate the search-related online advertising market. According to Google, the websites in question did not comply with some of Adwords terms and conditions Google claims that the suspension is justified because Gibmedia did not comply with three AdWords rules, namely the ban on charging for goods or services that are normally free, transparency to consumers in relation to charges and the ban on using concealment techniques.  In September 2014, Google updated the wording of the rules governing its Adwords services. While the previous wording made it possible to understand what Google did and did not allow and provided guidance as to what an advertiser should do to abide by these rules, the new wording was shorter and much less detailed. In the case in question, the Adwords rules that were breached have now been regrouped into a single category entitled \"untrustworthy promotions\" It has in particular become apparent that this presentation made it difficult for the company to understand the precise grounds for the suspension. Search engine advertising must be transparent and objective As the Autorité already stated, notably in its Navx decision , Google may freely define the principles to be respected by the companies whom it references in its advertising offer, provided that: - the principles that it set outs are not in themselves anticompetitive; - these principles are implemented by means of a transparent, objective and non-discriminatory process. Whatever Google's opinion on the compatibility of certain characteristics of the offers proposed by GibMedia with the ethics of the services it intends to promote among its users, the possibility cannot be excluded, at this stage of the investigation, that Google has not defined the Adwords terms and conditions, as well as the account suspension process in a sufficiently transparent, clear and objective manner. These facts, if confirmed by the investigation, would be liable to constitute an anticompetitive practice. The conditions for granting interim measures have not been met, but investigation into the merits of the case continues The Autorité has therefore decided to continue investigating the merits of the case. The Autorité does not, however, order any interim measures, considering that no serious or immediate harm to the interests of the consumers, the sector or the complainant company has been qualified as such.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité fines TDF 5.6 million euros for practices aimed at foreclosing its competitors from the Eiffel Tower site. > Version française  After the adoption of interim measures in 2007, the Autorité de la concurrence is today fining TDF 5.6 million euros for distortion of competition in the market for the renewal of the national occupancy contract of the Eiffel Tower site and in the sector relating to FM radio terrestrial broadcasting from the same site. TowerCast's complaint TowerCast, a subsidiary of the NRJ group, specialises in terrestrial broadcasting. It alleged that TDF had implemented several practices that in particular prevented it from expanding within the FM radio broadcasting market from the Eiffel Tower. TowerCast held that TDF had sent it the information that it needed in order to respond to the tender launched by the City of Paris for renewal of the national occupation agreement of the Eiffel Tower site belatedly and in an incomplete form. TowerCast likewise complained that TDF, the national occupant, had carried out similar practices on the hosting market, thus preventing it from making broadcasting offers to radio stations. It also alleged a margin squeeze practice preventing it from submitting a competitive offer to these radio stations. The interim measures adopted in 2007 In its decision 07-MC-05 , the Conseil de la concurrence, (the Autorité's predecessor) deemed that the hosting offered by TDF did not allow TowerCast to make offers to radio stations that might offer competition to its own. Inasmuch as it was the eve of the issue by the CSA (French Broadcasting Council) of new authorisations for the use of frequencies by private radio stations, the Conseil issued an interim measure which ordered TDF to put forward a new wholesale hosting offer for FM radio broadcasting from the Eiffel Tower site so that alternative operators could compete effectively with the offers made by TDF to the radio stations. The Autorité de la concurrence today issued its decision on the merits of the case. The Eiffel Tower, a strategic site for the broadcasting of radio and TV programmes Among all the main audiovisual broadcasting sites, the Eiffel Tower site stands out for its particularly broad coverage due to its height. It can reach 11 million inhabitants in the Ile-de-France region, namely 18% of the metropolitan population. The site is used for the broadcasting of all terrestrial DTT services and 30 radio stations. Access to this site is thus essential for broadcasters if they are to be in a position to make broadcasting offers to stations. The practices implemented TDF transmitted to TowerCast belatedly and in incomplete form the information which was essential in order for it to respond to the tender launched by the City of Paris In 2006, when for the first time the City of Paris launched a tender for the renewal of the national occupancy agreement of the Eiffel Tower terrestrial broadcasting site, TDF, the heir of a legal monopoly and outgoing holder of the site occupancy agreement, was the only party to be in possession of all the technical and pricing information that competitors needed in order to put together their bids. This was particularly true in relation to the assets that it would have had to transfer to any competitor chosen by the City under conditions that would allow continuity of service to be maintained. TDF's competitors were, therefore, at the mercy of its good will. However, TDF provided this information to TowerCast belatedly and in partial form. It also provided an overestimated valuation of the assets that it would have had to transfer, preventing TowerCast from submitting a bid that was sufficiently precise and competitive for the requirements of the City of Paris's specifications.  TDF provided the information that TowerCast needed in order to put together its radio broadcast offer belatedly and in incomplete form In order to be in a position to make broadcasting offers to radio stations, TDF's competitors need to be hosted by the occupant of the Eiffel Tower site. Hosting is a technical necessity for alternative broadcasters, who do not hold occupancy authorisation, and a legal obligation for the host, in this case TDF, stipulated in the national occupancy agreement. As a result of not providing a sufficiently comprehensive, tailored offer in time to meet the obligatory deadlines linked to the renewal of frequency authorisations by radio stations seeking a broadcaster, TDF prevented competition from operating on the downstream market of FM radio broadcasting services from the Eiffel Tower site. TDF implemented anti-competitive pricing Finally, the hosting offers that TDF made to alternative operators constituted a margin squeeze. Without sufficient economic room, the latter were deprived of the possibility of making offers that could compete with those of TDF. The fines imposed By implementing these practices, TDF deprived alternative operators of any possibility of competing effectively and weakened the competitive playing field that would have normally prevailed for audiovisual broadcasting from the Eiffel Tower site. In particular, radio broadcasters were unable to take advantage of the decrease in prices that they could have expected after the market was opened up to competition. The Autorité has announced two fines that include an additional 25% surcharge as it is a repeat offence - TDF was fined in 1999 for having refused to install and maintain re-broadcasting equipment on the sites that it operated in a discriminatory and non-transparent way: the fine imposed for anticompetitive practices in the context of the renewal of the national occupancy agreement for the Eiffel tower site amounts to 5 million euros;    the fine imposed for distorting competition on the wholesale market upstream of radio broadcasting and for margin squeeze is 660,000 euros. This takes into account that, as a result of the intervention by the Autorité de la concurrence, which implemented interim measures in 2007, these practices only lasted a few months.

Going beyond their legal obligations , which only require them to refrain from implementing any exclusivity agreement without sufficient justification, the companies have proposed to periodically select their non-exclusive wholesalers on the basis of transparent, non-discriminatory tendering or competitive procedures. This process ought to make it possible to enhance competition between wholesalers, or even to bring new operators into the market, and ultimately to boost price competition for the consumer goods in question, to the benefit of overseas customers. Distribution of consumer goods in the overseas territories Consumer goods distributed by retailers in the overseas territories are not generally produced or packaged by local companies but by manufacturers from mainland France and then shipped from continental Europe. To do so, the manufacturers use the services of intermediaries, known as “wholesale importers” or “brand agents”, who perform various logistical (storage, delivery) or commercial operations and sell on the goods purchased to retailers. Exclusive distribution relationships The Autorité's investigation has shown that, in most cases, a single wholesale importer per territory ensures the distribution of a given brand, or even all of a manufacturers' goods and brands. Some manufacturers grant their overseas commercial middlemen de facto or de jure exclusive relationships for the supply of certain overseas territories. Those exclusive relationships are likely to constitute practices prohibited by law. The four manufacturers concerned – Bolton Solitaire, Danone, Johnson & Johnson Santé et Beauté France and Pernod-Ricard – thus expressed their wish to offer commitments to remedy this situation. Commitments going beyond their legal obligations The four manufacturers have committed to establish non-exclusive distribution agreements with the wholesale importers. Quickly after the start of the proceedings, they have expressed their wish to go beyond their legal obligations by proposing to select periodically their non-exclusive wholesalers on the basis of transparent, non-discriminatory tendering or competitive procedures. These commitments will boost competition After market testing these commitments (see market test of 13 May 2015), the Autorité de la concurrence has considered that these commitments do address its competition concerns. It has accepted them and made them binding. These commitments should thus make it possible to boost competition between wholesale importers, or even bring new operators in the market. Moreover, the Autorité continues investigating similar practices implemented by other companies in the consumer goods retail sector. 1 The brands in question are, among others: Carolin, WC net, Sanogyl… (for Bolton Solitaire SAS) ; Volvic, Evian, Badoit, Gallia, Blédina… (for Danone SA) ; Le Petit Marseillais, Vania, Nett, Neutrogena, Laboratoires Vendôme… (for Johnson & Johnson Santé et Beauté France) ; Ricard, Pastis 51, Clan Campbell, Absolut Vodka… (for Pernod-Ricard). The territories concerned by these commitments proposals are: La Réunion, Mayotte, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Saint-Barthélémy, Saint-Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Having carried out an analysis of the market and consulted with players active in the sector, the Autorité de la Concurrence publishes its opinion. The Autorité considers that the competitive operation of standardisation and certification processes may be improved by the application of simplification measures, as well as greater transparency in the processes currently in use. The construction and public works [BTP] sector, which has a number of distinctive features, has been the subject of particular review resulting in specific recommendations for that sector. > version française  In brief see press release published on April 13th 2015 Norme Française Bâtiment et Travaux Publics ENSURING STANDARDISATION QUALITY IN ORDER TO BENEFIT COMPETITION By facilitating compatibility and interoperability between different products and services, the adoption of standards has a positive effect on competition, as it promotes diversity of offer and allows purchasers to compare various aspects of a product or service more easily, thus improving competition on the merits. Conversely, a misused standard may restrict market competition. The Autorité recommends streamlining standardisation bodies and their working methods In France, the standardisation process is overseen by AFNOR. More specifically, the actual creation of standards is carried out by AFNOR's Standardisation Committees and the Sectoral Standardisation Officeswhose role is to gather input from companies interested in the development of standards for their respective areas of business activity. Inquiries and information gleaned from the public consultation have revealed a relative deficit in oversight of standardisation bodies by AFNOR, which does not have detailed knowledge of relevant standardisation committees, current member lists, the origin of their funding or the schedules of their planned operations. the Autorité recommends improving the upstream standardisation process by - Reducing and streamlining the number of standardisation bodies in operation, especially those which are inactive or whose activity overlaps with that of another committee . The Autorité stresses that these simplification measures will require proactive action on the part of the government, as AFNOR does not have the legal authority to control the proliferation of standardisation organisations; - Strengthening the steering role played by AFNOR in the standardisation process (centralising information, formalising the decisions to initiate works, online publication of work schedules, verifying effective consultation with relevant stakeholders, oversight of resource allocation, etc.). The Autorité recommends upstream reflection on the need for new standards An inadequate standardisation process may affect economic efficiency and restrict competition if it produces useless standards whose economic cost/benefit ratio has not been proven, or if it allows the approval of a standard that is biased towards certain market operators, who may then be able to use said standard as an barrier to prevent competitors or innovators from entering the market . These dangers are all the more serious given that useless standards are highly difficult to detect and correct once the standardisation process has been completed. It is for this reason that the Autorité considers that a company which suggests the introduction of a new standard should be capable of explaining why it is necessary; the reasons being put forth in support of the standard should be available for review and, where relevant, refuted by their competitors . The Autorité recommends the implementation of a mandatory step in order to validate the added value expected to be brought about by the introduction of a new standard or revision of an existing one > The Autorité recommends that this mandatory validation phase should be formalised via the composition of a handbook or set of guidelines. CLARIFYING CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION ACTIVITIES Certification is a procedure by which a third party confirms that a product or service meets a certain number of characteristics which have been defined in a reference document known as a “Certification Rules”, to which professional clients and consumers are expected to attach particular importance in their purchasing decisions. Regarding the scope and cost of accreditations While certification operations are open to competition, in certain sectors they may only be carried out by accredited organisations, known as “Conformity Assessment Bodies”, or CABs (French: Organismes d'Evaluation de la Conformité, or OECs), whose ability to carry out said operations is validated in France by the COFRAC (French Accreditation Committee). In France, seeking accreditation is often seen as a pre-requisite for businesses to be able to develop, even in those sectors in which it is not compulsory. In addition, several responses to the public consultation mentioned excessive costs, or even prohibitive for moderately-sized certification bodies . Regarding the various activities of the AFNOR group AFNOR plays a central role in the French standardisation system, but the group is also involved in certification and training by way of its subsidiaries AFNOR-Certification and AFNOR Compétences, which are developing significant commercial operations. The conditions in which these subsidiaries operate can raise competition concerns , if they derive an unfair advantage from the prevalent confusion between their own operations and those of their parent company. Regarding the status of the 'NF' mark The ‘NF' acronym, accompanied by an identification number indicating an AFNOR-approved standard, stands for 'Norme française', or 'French standard'. However, this symbol is also used to signify that a product conforms to a frame of reference developed by a subsidiary body named AFNOR Certification, which may not be connected to any approved standard but is nonetheless presented to consumers as a selling point. To this initial confusion is added the fact the AFNOR allows certain certification partner organisations the option of placing the NF logo on the products they audit. This practice has been questioned by other non-partner CABs, to whom the NF certification market remains inaccessible. > As regards the certification activity, the Autorité issues several recommendations aimed at preventing various competition risks: - the Autorité recommends that COFRAC publish on its website a list of fields and sectors for which accreditation is compulsory, as well as estimated costs which should be regularly compared with their European counterparts; - the Autorité also encourages AFNOR to implement, where necessary, simple measures aimed at preventing the creation of circumstances which may unfairly benefit its subsidiaries or be harmful to competing operators; - regarding the current confusion surrounding the use of the NF mark, the Autorité proposes a critical framework for this issue and invites public authorities and AFNOR to quickly determine a positioning for the NF mark and draw the appropriate consequences for the network of NF certification partner bodies. SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND CIVIL ENGINEERING (\"BTP\") SECTOR Overriding and proliferating standardisation The construction and civil engineering (“BTP”, Bâtiment et Travaux Publics , in French) sector is characterised by a proliferation of \"quasi-standards\", which have not been validated by AFNOR and are not approved, but that have nevertheless, in practice, assumed a compulsory nature for construction techniques that belong to the so-called \"traditional” field. Among these are DTUs ( documents techniques unifiés - building code), which are now referred to as NF-DTU; public authorities have begun the work of progressively integrating these concepts into the common legal standardisation process. The competitive ramifications of this update process are significant, as this group of documents in its entirety is viewed by industry professionals and insurance bodies as the \"state of the art\" when it comes to construction. Overriding quasi-certification for innovative products and processes In a similar way, ATs and DTAs ( avis  techniques and documents techniques d'application , both types of technical advice documents) which apply to innovative products are not legally compulsory but are required in practice by project managers and insurers. They are formulated by a specialist commission, the CCFAT, whose administrative bodies and information centres are entrusted to the Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (Scientific and Technical Construction Centre, or CSTB). The procedure, which often involves laboratory testing, can be expensive; currently the cost is met by the company whose product is being tested, which needs de facto to pass the evaluation in order to ensure successful entry into the market. Public consultation has revealed that the procedure has drifted from its intended purpose, as the majority of technical evaluations pertain to renewals of quasi-certifications and are aimed at products which are already on the market, in some cases for a very long time, and not at new products or innovative processes. > The Autorité recommends that the certification process should be completed for DTUs > Regarding technical evaluations for innovative products, the Autorité suggests that evaluation inquiries should be made open to competition, in particular via the intervention of accredited certification bodies . > The Autorité recommends that the renewal of technical evaluations over 7 years old should be highly limited, or banned outright. > The Autorité also recommends ensuring that technical evaluations are not required (and therefore delivered against payment) for innovative products whose use has already been legally authorised by the European Union. > See full opinion 15-A-16 of 16 November 2015 reviewing standardisation and certification processes in the light of competition law Press Contact: Rebecca Hébert / Tel: +33 (0)1 55 04 01 81 / Email",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Today, the Autorité de la concurrence issues a decision by which it fines two anticompetitive agreements in the delivery service industry for a total amount of 672.3 million euros: The principal agreement in question has been subject to a penalty of 670.9 million euros. It concerns 20 companies as well as the professional trade associations TLF (transport and logistics trade association) and involved, during the period between 2004 and 2010, repeated collusions between competitors regarding annual price increases. A smaller-scale agreement involving 15 of the same companies as well as TLF was also fined an amount of 1.4 million euros.  It concerned defining a common method for passing on the costs of a “diesel surcharge”. > French version  THE KEY POINTS Today, the Autorité de la concurrence issues a decision concerning a case which has been brought to its attention through the leniency procedure. The Autorité principally fines 20 delivery service companies for coordinating on annual price increases that they charged their respective clients. This information sharing process, which occurred between September 2004 and September 2010, mainly took place during meetings held within the framework of a professional trade association body (TLF) which has also been fined. Round table discussions were regularly organised upstream and downstream of the price increase campaigns, enabling the companies to harmonise their pricing demands and secure their business negotiations. The discussions were kept secret with no official minutes being taken . These discussions were completed, with regard to some companies, by bilateral or multilateral exchanges . The following companies were involved in the agreement: Alloin, BMVirolle, Chronopost, Exapaq (now known as DPD France), Ciblex, Dachser France, DHL Express France, FedEx Express France, Gefco, Geodis, GLS France, Heppner, Lambert et Valette, XP France, Norbert Dentressangle Distribution, Normatrans, Schenker-Joyau (now known as Schenker France), TNT Express France, Transports Henri Ducros, Ziegler France.        The professional trade association sanctioned is TLF. The documents in the case file show that TLF, instead of playing its role of vigilance in terms of compliance with competition rules, actively participated in organising unlawful discussions whilst also protecting their confidentiality. When calculating the penalties, the Autorité took into account the duration of the practices, their seriousness and the harm caused to the economy in particular to SMEs, which due to their insufficient negotiating power, were the first victims of the agreement. It nevertheless adapted its penalties to the specifics of the case, in particular by reducing, for six companies (Ciblex, Heppner, Lambert et Valette, XP France, Transport Henri Ducros and Ziegler) the amount of the penalties by more than 90% in order to take into account their current financial difficulties (see summary table at the end of the press release). Moreover, the Autorité, when calculating the penalties, took into account the leniency applications and the fact that the charges were not challenged (settlement procedure). Moreover, this decision sanctions 15 of the same companies as well as TLF, for having reached anti-competitive agreements, between May 2004 and January 2006, on the principle and the method used to pass on the costs (at the bottom of invoices) of the increase in the price of diesel to their clients. A case revealed thanks to the leniency programme PARCEL DELIVERY : a key business for the french industry THE DELIVERY SERVICE COMPANIES REACHED AN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE ANNUAL PRICE  NCREASES WHICH THEY INTENTED TO CHARGE THEIR CLIENTS  A considerable amount of evidence was obtained concerning this case provided both directly by the two leniency applicants (statements, hearings) and also contained in the documents obtained during dawn raids conducted in September 2010 during the course of seven annual price increase campaigns held between September 2004 and September 2010, the delivery service and express delivery service companies shared, within a multi-party context, in particular during TLF meetings, sensitive business information relating to their annual pricing increases Roundtable discussions during the trade council's meetings “ 2010 price increase . We had agreed in June to tackle this subject (…) ( emphasis added ). And the TLF Manager replied: “ to prevent TLF and the member companies of the organisation in attendance from facing the risks of inspections and financial penalties on the part of the conseil de la concurrences [sic](Autorité) hence my cautious approach. when speaking the participants raise the issues they want to ”  (emphasis added) . (§ 331 of the decision). “I am sending this email in order to inform you of the great displeasure of all the members of the Conseil de Métier Messagerie Express TLF (TLF Express Parcel Delivery Trade Committee ), concerning your 2005 price increase circular letter of 15 November. It doesn't correspond in any way to what had been discussed together during our meeting, and is seemingly in total contrast to the attitude you have always shown, and which we have all ardently defended. We are all wondering whether it is worth continuing our collaboration in the Parcel Delivery Service Committee of TLF” (emphasis added). § 364 of the decision Bilateral discussions between companies consolidated the agreement - An email was seized in which a Dachser Sales Director says to several of his company's managers ”. §499 - Documents show that, during the summer of 2007, Schenker-Joyau not only provided Dachser with information on its own pricing policy but also the details it had concerning another competitor, namely Calberson (Geodis). Paragraph 435 Faced with the increase in the price of diesel, the PARCEL delivery services companies decided together to pass on this increase to their CLIENTS Serious nationwide practices concerning a key sector of the french economy The concerted practices related to price increases Contacts took place between the main players in the French market. The companies concerned, many of whom are backed by major European or global groups, represent a significant part of the industry's turnover industrial and business sectors were affected by the practices, including e-commerce, a rapidly expanding sector. In consequence, a large majority of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) making up the backbone of the French industry suffered the most from the practices as they had the price increases applied directly to them without being able to negotiate them which thus impacted their competitiveness. Consumers might also have been affected, as transport is an important component of the cost price of goods sold online. The diesel surcharge The penalties imposed Leniency Concerning the objection of an agreement concerning price increases, the Deutsche Bahn group did not, however, obtain the total immunity from penalties it could have been granted as a ‘type 1' leniency applicant. By omitting to inform the investigation services of an anticompetitive meeting which it had attended in September 2010, it failed to satisfy one of its obligations. Consequently, the Autorité imposed a penalty of 3 million euros on it. Having fully cooperated, Kuehne+Nagel (Alloin) benefited from a 30% reduction as a ‘type 2' leniency applicant, the highest percentage possible with regard to its conditional notice of leniency. Necessary but proportionate penalties With regard to the infringement relating to passing on the price of diesel at the bottom of invoices, it departed from the application of its guidelines concerning penalties in order to take into account the exceptional circumstances linked to the economic context and the intervention of the public authorities which created a certain confusion for companies in this field, and decided to apply a proportionate penalty in this very particular situation. It also took into account the financial difficulties experienced by several companies to pay the fine. As regards six companies (Ciblex, Heppner, Lambert et Valette, XP France, Transport Henri Ducros and Ziegler), a reduction of more than 90% in relation to the amount theoretically due was granted. the Autorité de la concurrence imposed an overall penalty of 672 million euros. > For further details on this matter, the full text of decision 15-D-19 of 15 December 2015 relating to practices implemented in the standard and express delivery industry is available .

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrenceis in favour of fishing quota reforms leading to fairer and more efficient methods of quota allocation > Version française Overview Cobrenord, a maritime cooperative, sought the opinion of the Autorité de la concurrence on the allocation mechanisms currently used to attribute fishing quotas in France. In an opinion issued today, the Autorité considers that the method of collective management of quotas practised in France is inefficient, and constitutes a threat to fair competition. The Autorité suggests the introduction of individual quotes being directly allocated to producers, following the example of CO2 emissions quota management Why volume regulation is necessary Fish stocks are a limited natural resource shared by the entire fishing industry. While all producers are given completely free access to the resource, each fisherman or trawler has an incentive to fish as much as possible and as quickly as possible, thereby appropriating the greatest quantity of the resource while fish stocks last: this is the root of the \"race-to-fish\" phenomenon. In the medium term, however, it is in the collective interests of fishing companies to manage fish stocks as rationally as possible, in order to ensure that stock renewal can be maintained.  In regulatory terms, the goal is to enable market players to effectively develop their economic activity and remain profitable even in a context that requires their access to resources to be limited. How fishing quotas operate The European Union sets quotas for the most widely-fished species in European waters, in order to ensure adequate management of fish stocks. These quotas set out catch limits for fishing of a particular species within a given maritime zone and time period. In France, the management of quotas allocated by the European Commission is, in principle, free and collective: as sub-quotas are allocated free of charge, they cannot be monetised. National sub-quotas are allocated either directly to producers, or to Producer Organisations (POs), who are then responsible for distributing these sub-quotas among their members. The initial distribution of quotas between producers and POs is mainly based on the criteria of \"fixed right of priority\", which is determined based on the amount of fish caught by a given vessel over the 2001-2003 reference period. POs may then distribute sub-quotas between fishing vessels using the criteria of their choice. In the case of \"overstretched\" species (for which the sub-quota sets a limit that is lower than the level of demand from fishermen), OPs also tend to rely on a system of fixed right of priority in order to distribute individual catch limits among their members. Inefficiency in the French system  The use of fixed priority systems to determine fishing vessels' access to resources leads to two main issues: - firstly, it creates an automatic state of inequality between POs, as well as an aspect of “intergenerational” inequality within individual POs (between those producers who were operating high-capacity catching vessels between 2001 and 2003, and those having entered the market more recently). Such a situation does not work in favour of the most efficient operators or POs; - secondly, in this system, the fixed priority status of a given vessel brings added value to the latter (implicit, yet real value) as and when the vessel is sold or changes hands. As the fixed priority status is transferable from one crew or owner to another, fishermen naturally prefer to purchase older vessels with favourable priority status, rather than investing in new, less oil-consuming and more environmentally-friendly vessels that are better-suited to the evolution of the fishing industry. As such, the current system, while free of charge in principle, encourages the creation of a “priority market”, generating income for older vessels and leading to an overall aging of active fleets. Competition risks identified by the Autorité The current system for quota allocation also constitutes a risk to competition within the industry: - firstly, there is a risk of discrimination regarding new entrants to the market, who may have to join a PO in order to gain access to the shared resource . The admission of a new member with little or no priority status effectively means that a PO must spread its quota allocation over a greater number of members, without any consequential increase in the number of quotas being distributed. This risk is further increased by the fact that POs are not obliged to accept new membership requests, nor to provide an explanation for the refusal of an application; - secondly, the distribution of sub-quotas between members of a PO using fixed priority criteria gives vessels with greater precedence an undue competitive advantage . The criteria used to differentiate fishing vessels is, in fact, based on past activity, and does not account for objective considerations that are economically justified and achievable by every operator based on their individual merit. The recommendations of the Autorité  In the wake of the quota management reforms of December 2014, the Autorité invitespublic authorities to pursue the reform process in order to create an efficient and coherent management system. The most effective solution: individual transferable quotas In order to respond to environmental, economic and competitive concerns relating to this issue, the Autorité is in favour of the introduction of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) - which follow the example of the system used to manage the quotas for CO2 emissions - at least in regard to commercial fishing of overstretched species. This system would see individual operators receive the right to catch a certain quantity of fish within a given timeframe. Producers would therefore be able to adapt their production operations to these objectives, and transfer unused quotas to competitors. The implementation of ITQs would thus lead to the disappearance of the illicit commodification of fixed priority status, and would encourage producers to invest in more modern vessels and equipment.  By removing the influence of fixed priority based on dated information, and relieving POs of their role as gatekeepers in the management of sub-quotas, the introduction of ITQs would also contribute to reducing competition risks, notably the risk of discrimination between operators .  This reform, which has been successfully implemented by a number of other countries, may be accompanied by measures discouraging excessive industrial concentration in order to preserve traditional fishing methods. Alternative Solution: collective management methods based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory of quotas  While the principle of free and collective management should be maintained, the Autorité considers that an in-depth review of the current system is necessary, in order to render it capable of functioning in an efficient and non-discriminatory manner . The Autorité proposes the following practical measures: - a pooling of quotas between POs, encouraging individual POs to merge with one another so that a given section of coastline would be overseen by a single organisation. This would put an end to systemic inequality and encourage a multi-species perspective, which would have the notable effect of improving the industry's ability to cope with quota reductions; - a progressive adaptation of the years used as a reference period, substituting 2011-2013 in place of 2001 - 2003 so as to take into account evolutions in the fishing market; - increased transparency in the conditions by which new entrants are able to gain membership of POs, guaranteeing objective, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions of access; - finally, a return to genuinely collective principles of resource management by POs themselves, who would progressively desist from attributing individual catch limits based on fixed priority criteria. The French government could encourage these developments using the national reserve of priority claims, which could be supplemented by the proceeds of vessel transfers and fleet retirement.   These quotas do not apply to the Mediterranean Sea, since not all countries surrounding the Mediterranean are E.U. members > See the full text of Opinion 15-A-19 of 16 December 2015, on the effects on competition of the fishing quota allocation mechanism used in France > Press contact: Anne-Elisabeth Akrasi /Tel. + 33(0) 1 55 04 01 46 Email",

The commitment made by the Altice/Numericable group to the divestiture of its Outremer Telecom mobile telephony in La Réunion and Mayotte  On 30 October 2014, the Autorité de la concurrence authorised the Altice/Numericable group to take exclusive control of SFR. In order to address the significant market power that Numericable and Altice would acquire in mobile telephony in the Indian Ocean (66% market shares in La Réunion, 90% in Mayotte), Altice and Numericable have committed to divesting their Outremer Telecom mobile telephony activities in La Réunion and Mayotte. In particular, Altice and Numericable made a commitment, in the run-up to divestiture, to maintain the viability, market value and competitiveness of this business . They also made a commitment not to interfere with the management of the divested concerns. By increasing the price of Outremer Telecom's mobile telephone subscription prices in La Réunion and Mayotte, the Altice/Numericable group failed to respect its commitments During the period in which these commitments applied, the mobile phone subscription rates, including some of those sold most widely such as Rife 2h and Next 2 Illimité, underwent significant increases of between +17 % and +60 %. These took place after the Autorité 's decision to grant conditional authorisation of Numericable's acquisition of SFR.  These price increases put the competitiveness of Outremer Telecom's offer at considerable risk, by giving customers the opportunity to terminate their current subcription without any charge (in January 2015, cancellation rates were three times higher than those recorded on average in 2014) at a time when competitors, SRR and Orange, had just repositioned their pricing to a lower level.  These price increases, which have had a negative impact on Outremer Telecom's image, constituted a reversal in the divested activity's commercial strategy, which until then had always been geared towards capturing new customers on the basis of aggressive pricing.  This breach of the commitments undertaken was aggravated by the fact that the Autorité was never informed of the decisions to increase prices and that the decisions were only cancelled after the procedure for non-compliance with commitments was initiated. Furthermore, these changes in commercial policy were decided while Altice Numericable had committed to appointing an independent manager for the period prior to the divestiture of the company and was aware that, in the meantime, the divested concerns had to be managed as though by this independent manager. The practices implemented by the Altice/Numericable group were of a serious nature and called for the imposition of a fine  The price increases were of an unprecedented form and extent for an operator in Outremer Telecom's situation in La Réunion and Mayotte as they did not only affect new customers but also existing customers - an extremely rare practice from a commercial point of view.  The Altice/Numericable group thus ignored the basic obligations aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of the commitment to divest Outremer Telecom's mobile telephony concerns and which were therefore essential for maintaining competition.  In the light of these elements, the Autorité has imposed a fine of 15 million euros.  The Autorité has approved in june 2015 the sale to the firm Hiridjee of the Outremer Telecom mobile operations. > See decision 16-D-07 of 19 April 2016 > Press contact: Aurore Giovannini / Tel.: +44 1 55 04 01 81 / Email > See decision of the Conseil d'Etat - 31 March 2017",

These construction products are used by construction and public works companies to strengthen buildings or construction works forming part of transport infrastructure such as bridges and viaducts. In La Réunion, transport intermediaries bring the steel wire for the manufacture of these products onto the island. They are then processed in situ and sold on to the construction companies. Three anticompetitive practices sanctionned Between 2004 and 2009, demand for metal frames and welded mesh in La Réunion increased massively following the start of works on major infrastructure projects, such as the Tamarins road. To meet this demand, a new processing and production company was set up, the company Arma Sud. However, companies Sermétal and Réunion Armatures, the largest welded mesh and metal frames processors on the island, along with Ravate group, the main trading and resale company, have agreed with Arma Sud, under which the latter would not compete with either Sermétal or Réunion Armatures and would only participate as their subcontractor. These practices lasted from June 2006 to April 2007 on the welded mesh market and from May 2006 to June 2008 on the metal frames market.  In addition, between 2005 and 2011, a large part of the sector's operators (transporters, processors, traders/resellers) implemented a series of practices aimed at limiting the development of alternative welded mesh resellers. The companies entered into anticompetitive practices aimed at ensuring that the sale price of welded mesh was less favourable for resellers who were not members of the cartel. In addition, measures to block imports have been implemented. The companies KDI Davum, Ravate Professionnel and Sermétal Réunion participated in this anticompetitive practice, as did the hauliers and transport intermediaries C. Steinweg, Mer Union N.V. and Organitrans. Practices involving the whole of the Construction and Public Works sector in La Réunion These agreements between competitors are serious. They have prevented any development of the market and frozen competition to the detriment of the construction and public works companies that purchase these construction materials. All work sites in La Réunion have been affected by these practices, in particular the Tamarins road project.

Besides, the Autorité has fined a loyalty rebate system encouraging TV channels to use TDF's services  for most of their requirements. > Version française  In brief The Autorité de la concurrence fines TDF 20.6 million Euros for abusively hindering its competitors' development during Digital terrestrial television's (DTT) deployment between 2006 and 2010. TDF has denigrated its competitors upon a risk of disturbance should a collocated pylon be installed, and has abusively intervened with concerned local public authorities to deter them from clearing the establishment of competitor's infrastructures. TDF had also set up a loyalty rebate system by geographic areas which strongly encouraged channel editors, gathered in multiplexes, to use TDF's services for the major part of their broadcasting requirements. The terrestrial Hertzian broadcasting sector and Itas Tim's complaint In order to be received in the entire territory, TV channels have to use the services of broadcasters in charge of delivering their signals to French households' antennas, this broadcasting method being mandatory. Broadcasting from high points according to a territorial grid set by the CSA, operators have to obtain clearance from public authorities to build pylon sites eligible for the accommodation of their technical broadcasting equipment and, thus, being capable of responding autonomously to the multiplexes' call for tenders. Former state monopoly, TDF is the sector's leader with 80% of terrestrial Hertzian broadcasting market shares. Its main competitors are Towercast and Itas Tim which filed the complaint. The company transferred the matter to the Autorité de la concurrence in September 2009, blaming TDF for hampering its infrastructures' establishment near its own sites. In the decision 10-D-09 , the Autorité has rejected interim measures' requests for lack of urgency but referred the case for investigation into the merits which is subject to the present decision. TDF has disseminated a depreciating and deceiving allégations to local public authorities to spur them into refusing the establishment of competitor's broadcasting sites nearby its own facilities. When DTT was deployed, TDF addressed in July 2009 to nearly all mayors of the Alsace area, first region concerned with the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting, an email instructing to notify TDF with any request concerning competitor's pylon installation to prevent radio disturbance risks, in particular due to the existence of easements they would benefit from. In other regions, especially during 2009, TDF gave several mayors negative opinions concerning the establishment of competitor's pylons as part of the investigation on notices prior installation, yet again on the same ground of preventing radio disturbance risks. Yet, said risks are not related to the installation of competitor's pylons on the one hand, and on the other hand fall within the scope of very ordinary common law prevention procedures. As a private company operating on a competitive market, TDF plays no specific part in these procedures being only consulted, as the other operators, by competent administrations before they issue a decision. However, by fear that a new facility would scramble TV reception for their constituents, several mayors have complied with TDF's negative opinions by refusing, based on radio disturbance risk, facilities which had been properly cleared by competent administrations. These practices mainly occurred in 2009. TDF has granted loyalty rebates to multiplexes in order to spur them into delegating their broadcasting sites in exclusive distribution or in their near-entirety Rebates offered by TDF were granted when more than one multiplex hired TDF for a substantial number of broadcasting sites in a given area: the more substantial the share of sites given to TDF was, the higher was the rebate percentage. In general, the rebate was granted only if at least 70% of involved sites were delegated to TDF. Serious practices By disparaging the establishment of competitor's broadcasting infrastructures and by exploiting easements from public authorities, TDF has blocked market entrance and its competitors' development by means not relying on a merit-based competition. TDF has thus erected barriers to entering the market, which were already substantial (natural and regulatory barriers in particular).  Furthermore, this practice occured at a time when, with the transition to fully digital networks, an exceptionnal development opportunity presented itself to alternative companies.  This practice is aggravated by the fact that TDF, exploiting its unequalled reputation with local public authorities, has maintained confusion between its situation as a private company and its former status, by profiting from easements granted in the times of public monopoly.  The application of loyalty rebates is equally serious, insofar as they were executed by the dominant operator, resulting in harming competition by favoring TDF's tenders. Penalties imposed Consequently, the Autorité fined TDF 20.6 million Euros (11.6 million for deceiving and disparaging discourse and 9 million for loyalty rebates).

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines UMICORE, one of the global leaders in zinc, €69 million for abuse of dominant position towards its competitors by practicing during 9 years a trade policy aiming at constraining its distributors to supply themselves exclusively from the company. > Version française  In brief The Autorité de la concurrence fines the belgian group Umicore (parent company as well as its French subsidiary), main supplier of rolled zinc in France, for implementing, between 1999 and 2007, a trade policy constraining its ditributors-retailers among which some important specialized companies (Point P, Asturienne, Larivière), to supply themselves exclusively from Umicore. This trade policy was accompanied by surveillance, threats and retaliation system aimed at taming the retailers and at ensuring they solely obtain supply from the Umicore's company.        This foreclosure policy enabled for 9 years Umicore to limit the access to the market of zinc distribution to its competitors and thus contributed to freeze the competition, and to create of an uncommon situation on the French territory (contrary to the situation in Germany for instance) : the competing rolling mills specialists could not develop and were abusively forced out of the market. The Autorité fined Umicore €69.2 million.         THE ROLLED ZINC SECTOR Zinc is used a lot in the construction sector, notably for roofing, facades and rain gutters. It is therefore transformed into metal sheets, strips and leaves, as well as in rainwater evacuation products ( EEP in French). The belgian group Umicore is one of the main global suppliers of rolled zinc, with the German Rheinzink. In France, Umicore, which sells its products under the brand VM Zinc, is the numer 1 of the sector with 70% of the market shares. Other rolling mills specialists can be found in France but they represent minor market shares : the German Rheinzink, the Dutch Nedzink, the American Altrista and the Italian Simar. Suppliers offer their products to dealers, generalists or specialized, who resell them to construction professionals, in particular roofers.   Umicore has selected a network of independent distributors, to which it granted the « VM Zinc » center status. These retailers, who represent the biggest zinc material tonnage, comprise brands from the groups Point P-St Gobain (Point P and Asturienne) and Larivière. UMICORE HAS IMPLEMENTED A TRADE POLICY AIMED AT FORCING ITS REGISTERED RETAILERS TO SUPPLY THEMSELVES EXCLUSIVELY FROM PRODUCTS OF ITS OWN BRAND, VM ZINC With the use of both a contractual and commercial system, Umicore has exerted pressure on its distributors in order for them to severely limit – if not exclude – supplying from competing suppliers. Exclusivity through a « promotion » clause Since 1999, Umicore has introduced in its retailers' contract a promotion clause under which the latter committed to ensuring “promotion of Umicore's products and brands to the exclusion of products and brands from competitors”. This exclusive promotion clause, effective until 2004, was then replaced by a less explicit one.  Several elements of the case (notes and e-mails seized at Umicore, statements of distributors and competing manufacturers) show however that, on the one hand, Umicore has used this clause in an ambiguous way, in order to constraint its distributors to supply themselves only with its products, and that, on the other hand, the latter also read into that clause in a very compelling way.  Thus for instance: A distributor's representative stated during a hearing: « (…) Il m'a été demandé très clairement de ne plus faire de marque concurrente et ce au regard des termes du contrat, qui certes n'indique pas formellement de ne vendre que la marque Umicore, mais qui, dans l'esprit et la demande des commerciaux Umicore voulait bien dire de ne pas vendre de produits concurrents » § 768 The Director General of a distributor stated during a hearing: « (…) la vente de zinc concurrent n'est pas compatible avec le statut de centre VM Zinc » §746 Local representatives also testified in this direction such as this former agency Director: « (…) Pour moi, le contrat Umicore est un contrat d'exclusivité. Il n'y avait pas de dérogation possible » § 748 Surveillance through stock and unilateral purchase review clauses. The stock clause  The VM Zinc centers had to have permanently available in their stocks the entirety of the VM Zinc products. But the elements of the case show a clear distortion of the purpose of this clause.  Indeed, according to statements collected, unscheduled stock visits were practiced in order to detect the presence of competitor's products at the distributors', rather than to verify the volume of the stock or the conditions of storage of VM Zinc products. Thus for instance: A distributor's former executive stated: « j'ai pu constater les visites de façon impromptue du directeur régional d'Umicore (…) et du responsable commercial. Ces visites avaient pour but de vérifier l'absence dans les stocks de produits concurrents à Vieille Montagne (...). Ce type de comportement était coutumier de la part des commerciaux de Vieille Montagne au point que certains distributeurs étaient amenés à cacher les produits en provenance de fournisseurs autres que Vieille Montagne » (cotes 6770-6771). In a similar fashion, these methods were also pointed out by the former Director of a distribution agency, which highlighted that: « Le responsable régional d'Umicore, était plus présent et avait une attitude d'inquisiteur, notamment sur la présence éventuelle de produits concurrents. » § 792  The unilateral tonnage review clause A unilateral tonnage review clause, supposed to allow Umicore to make forecasts for its manufacture, was also used to detect the potential selling of competitor's products by the VM Zinc centers. Unusually low sales or decline in order were followed by explanation requests addressed to the concerned distributors to discipline them.  Thus for instance: Umicore has blamed an agency for declining results while being in an increasing market, and accuse it of continuously selling zinc from competitor's brands: « Nous avions évoqué lors de notre dernier entretien vos résultats en baisse sur la famille laminés alors que le marché est en progression. Ayant évoqué la possibilité d'une substitution de nos produits par une marque concurrente, vous aviez répondu que ceci s'était effectivement produit une fois à travers la vente de 3 palettes de feuilles ». § 816 A SYSTEM BASED ON THREATS AND RETALIATION PERMITTED UMICORE TO ENSURE THAT THE RETAILERS WERE COMPLYING WITH THE EXCLUSIVE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AS WELL To ensure the compliance with the exclusivity clause, Umicore exerted threats and retaliation aimed at encouraging the VM Zinc centers to stay faithful to its brand. Several types of retaliation were implemented against VM Zinc distributors which had distributed zinc from competitors: reduction or suppression of bonuses (discounts) for faulty distributors; suspension of their “VM Zinc” status depriving them of preferential conditions (special supplier rates, attractive payments and delivery conditions). Thus for instance: A ditributor received threats for promoting and selling competitor's products :« Étant entendu que vous n'avez pas respecté les engagements qui nous lient contractuellement, nous considérons les critères de BFAE 2005 non réalisés pour cette agence. » §827 Threats which have come true. (§ 830). In the same way, Umicore has made reproaches to a distributor in 2004 for supplying in slovenian zinc. During a hearing, he explained that these threats were followed by retaliatory measures from Umicore which suppressed its quality bonus, and then proceeded to the withdrawal of its VM Zinc center status in 2007: « J'ai commencé à m'approvisionner auprès de Roba en zinc slovène plus compétitif (…). J'ai eu très rapidement des réactions de VM Zinc marque commerciale d'Umicore. Les commerciaux de Bagnolet sont venus avec des copies de nos propositions commerciales et j'ai eu des menaces de retrait de centre Vieille Montagne. Leurs informations pouvaient venir des représentants régionaux (site d'Auby dans le département du Nord. Les menaces de VM Zinc ont été effectives à partir de 2005 puisque j'ai perdu les bonifications liées à la promotion (BFAE) soit 3,5 % et j'ai conservé celles liées au tonnage (BTS).Le 30 janvier 2007, j'ai reçu un courrier m'informant que je ne pouvais plus prétendre au statut de centre VM Zinc et de ce fait, je perds toutes les bonifications ». (§832) These threats and retaliation measures, if they concerned a limited number of distributors considering the fact that the majority of VM Zinc centers have spontaneously complied with Umicore's requirements, allowed Umicore, through a signaling effect, to tame the market.  This deterrent effect comes out of many statements collected during the investigation. For example: A competing supplier […] brought into light that: « Le distributeur a peur de perdre une partie de son chiffre d'affaires ou une partie de sa clientèle s'il tente de distribuer du Rheinzink ou un autre concurrent d'Umicore. Le critère n'est plus seulement la qualité du produit, le prix ou le service. Les distributeurs ont peur du changement car ils craignent la réaction d'Umicore » (§375) Similarly, the Italian […] stated: « Les portes m'étaient clairement fermées pour les enseignes Larivière, Asturienne et certaines agences Descours et Cabaud, avec qui la conversation tournait court en ce qui concerne les possibilités de vente du zinc Simar. Chaque enseigne brandissait avec fermeté le fait qu'[elle] soit centre VM et qu'[elle] devait en contre partie ne proposer à ses clients que du VM, faute de quoi [elle] s'exposait à des sanctions pécuniaires (perte de BFA en particulier). Partant de ce postulat il m'était difficile de contre argumenter » (§378).  In a similar way, the Commercial Director of […] company stated: « Les points VM Zinc vendent en exclusivité du zinc VM. (…) Les revendeurs ont peur de perdre le label VM. C'est très important pour un distributeur, car il bénéficie des prescriptions faites par VM en amont. VM lui garantit des commandes grâce à ses liens avec les prescripteurs » SERIOUS PRACTICES WHICH HAD HARMFUL EFFECTS ON COMPETING SUPPLIERS' DEVELOPMENT These practices, which lasted for 9 years, have had important consequences on the sector. The commercial policy implemented continuously between 1999 and 2007 towards the distributors made the access to the main distributors of zinc construction products harder and more expensive for competing suppliers. Indeed, the VM Zinc centers that represented almost 70% of zinc construction products' sales were a compulsory step to distribute efficiently these products. While preventing the development of competitors on the French market, the practices sanctioned have reduced the competition intensity and, as a matter of fact, conducted to supra-competitive prices: distributors, during their procurement of zinc, could not capitalize on a competition between Umicore and other suppliers. These high prices (from 5 to 15% more expensive) then had consequences on the retail prices. A €69,2 million sanction When fixing the amount of the sanction, the Autorité took into account the seriousness of the practices, of the damage caused to the economy as well as the duration of the practices. Concerning the latter, the duration that was considered is 9 years, while the objections initially notified to Umicore concerned a 15 years period. Furthermore, the Autorité has applied a 10% increase – Umicore pertaining to a worldwide size group (€9,7 billions in 2015) – while ensuring that the company was able to pay it without being in difficulty. Thus, the amount of the sanction is set to €69.2 million. Furthermore, the Autorité has considered that the existence of parallel importation practices, which were reproached to Umicore by instruction services, had not been proved.   > For further details, see full decision 16-D-14 of 23 June 2016 regarding practices in the zinc sector and manufactured zinc products dedicated to the building and civil engineering sector . > Press contact: Aurore GIOVANNINI / Tel.: 01 55 04 01 81 / Email > See decision of the Paris court of appeal (17 May 2018) and decision of 5th July 2018 > This Judgement was appealed before the Court of cassation/Supreme court of Appeal",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité fines for anticompetitive agreement the modelling sector's main professional union and 37 modelling agencies > Version française   In brief Autorité de la concurrence Modelling agencies and their services Modelling agencies are responsible for recruiting and training models as well as promoting them (via \"books\"), in particular to fashion magazines and advertising agencies, as well as haute-couture and ready-to-wear fashion houses. They find them contracts and negotiate their services with advertisers (Renault, Peugeot, Orange, Citroën, Leclerc, etc.), wishing to use the services of models in their advertising campaigns. Agencies can also contract with communication agencies or couture houses (Versace, Christian Dior, Chanel, etc.) regarding presentations of their collections at catwalk shows. Agencies differ hugely in terms of their reputation, territorial coverage, the type of model represented (exclusively men or women, both, children, actors) and the services provided (advertising photos and films, multi-activity agencies, etc.). The agencies Elite, Marilyn, IMG, Viva ou Next are among the best-known in the sector. Pricing schedules were drawn up and distributed every year by the professional union Pricing schedules were drawn up and distributed by the professional union shortly after the obligatory annual negotiations on models' minimum salaries and were classified (by type of service - photos, filming, catwalk, media - and in accordance with the model's reputation) as per the collective agreement.  The union was ambiguous as to the “official” nature of these pricing schedules, which not only covered minimum salary, but also established the total price that clients were invoiced for modelling services, with variations of up to three times minimum salary. Prices not only included the model's remuneration, but also the agency's margin. The schedules were published in early January and distributed to union members by letter, email and on its website. They applied throughout the following calendar year. This practice took place from 2000 to 2010. The agencies participated in meetings during which they discussed the drawing up, distribution and application of the union pricing schedules Between 2009 and 2010, 37 agencies, including sectoral leaders (Elite, Marilyn, IMG, Viva,…), representing almost the whole market, took part in statutory meetings during which they voted on increasing union prices and/or discussed a rule regarding the ban on distributing their own pricing schedules.  The pricing schedules were then used as a reference for negotiations with clients. In the context of Fashion Weeks, use of these schedules was virtually systematic with little or no room for negotiation. Practices which distorted the starting point for negotiations between modelling agencies and their clients and supported price alignment By acting above and beyond its primary task of providing information, advice and the defence of its members' professional interests, the union caused harm to the commercial autonomy of modelling agencies by price fixing and reduced competition on the market for the services provided by modelling agencies to their clients. By participating in the drawing up, distribution and, in some cases, application of pricing schedules, agencies distorted the basis for commercial negotiations and created obstacles to competition to the detriment of their clients. The pricing schedules therefore supported price alignment, as demonstrated by the statements made by several of the agencies: \" the agencies all charge the same commission rates and same invoice amounts. \" or \" We charge the rates that everyone charges, namely the rates distributed by the SYNAM. \" The fines In total, 2 381 000 euros in fines have been pronounced. In calculating them, the Autorité de la concurrence particularly took into account the seriousness of the practices and the damage caused to the economy. Finally, the Autorité took into account the financial difficulties encountered by several agencies, granting 3 agencies who did not contest the findings a 10% reduction in their fines. > See full text of decision n° 16-D-20 du 29 septembre 2016 concerning practices in sector of services provided by model agencies  > Press Contact : Aurore Giovannini / Tel : 01 55 04 01 81 / Mel > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (6th July 2017)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines the Altice group 80 million euros for the premature completion of two mergers notified in 2014 The Autorité de la concurrence issued a decision today to fine jointly Altice Luxembourg and SFR Group 80 million euros, in application of Section II of Article L. 430-8 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), for having prematurely completed two mergers, notified in 2014, in the electronic communications sector. Altice and SFR Group have contested neither the reality of the concerned practices, nor their legal characterisation. This decision is the first to be issued in Europe or anywhere else in the world in terms of the scale of practices sanctioned and the amount of fines handed out . It is also the first decision of this kind in France. While companies have already been sanctioned for failing to notify a merger or to fulfil their commitments, this case is the first in which the Autorité has had to adjudicate on the completion of a merger before the clearance decision has been issued, and specifically sanction this type of behaviour.  The Autorité de la concurrence has thus sent out a strong message to companies: they must not complete mergers prematurely, otherwise they could face heavy penalties. BACKGROUND  In 2014, the Altice group, which then operated in France through its subsidiary Numericable, notified the Autorité of two mergers: Acquisition of the SFR group This acquisition was notified on 5 June 2014 and cleared subject to commitments, following an in-depth examination, by the Autorité 's decision 14-DCC-160 of 30 October 2014 ( see press release ). SFR Numericable changed its name to SFR Group in April 2016. Acquisition of sole control of the OTL group (which, among other things, distributes telecoms services under the Virgin Mobile brand). This acquisition was notified on 25 September 2014 and cleared without commitment by decision 14-DCC-179 of 27 November 2014 ( see press release ). The Autorité found a number of clues - from competing operators in particular - which pointed to possible gun jumping in connection with both acquisitions. On 2 April 2015, it conducted dawn raids of Numericable, SFR and OTL premises to determine whether or not gun jumping practices had taken place. GUN JUMPING When it goes above certain thresholds, a merger must be notified to the Autorité , which must reach a decision on the effects of this joint purchasing agreement from the competitive point of view. Then the Autorité issues a clearance decision, subject, where necessary, to conditions (divestitures, commitments, etc.). The merger can only become effective after clearance by the Autorité (“suspensive” procedure).  Until this clearance is given, the parties to the merger must continue to behave as competitors and refrain from acting as a single entity (see note on mergers).  In this particular case, although the ownership of assets was not transferred during the suspensive period, the evidence shows that Altice's behaviour led it to exert a decisive influence on its targets and gave it access to a significant quantity of strategic information, even before it was given the clearance by the Autorité de la concurrence . THE ALTICE-SFR MERGER Intervention by Altice in SFR's operational management Altice intervened in the operational management of SFR on several occasions by validating a number of strategic decisions. The following examples illustrate this: - From May to October 2014, the principle and procedures relating to the participation of SFR Collectivités in a bid for a development project for a fibre optics public initiative network in the département of Seine-et-Marne were submitted to the most senior executive of the Altice group for approval.  - In October 2014, the renegotiation of a major mobile network sharing agreement between SFR and Bouygues Telecom (known as the “Crozon” contract) was also approved at the highest level. - As of June 2014, Altice directly intervened in SFR's sales policy, in particular in its pricing policy for its high-speed broadband Internet access offering. On 4 July, for example, two weeks after an intervention by Altice's President, SFR had to suspend a promotional offer on fibre, which was initially scheduled to last until 25 August. - SFR and Altice coordinated during the takeover of the OTL group. In April and May 2014, when SFR was initially planning to take over OTL and had put in a takeover bid, the company's CEO informed Altice's President of the amount of the proposed bid. But finally, in June, Altice replaced SFR in making the takeover bid.  Stronger economic ties between SFR and Numericable Altice and SFR took advantage of the suspensive period to implement an advance coordinated strategy for the two groups. They went so far as to negotiate and operationally prepare the launch of a new range of very high-speed broadband Internet access offers under the SFR brand, using the set-up boxes, TV packages and the Numericable network (known as a “whitelabel” project). This project marked a major turning point in SFR's high-speed broadband strategy which, until then had concentrated on developing its own infrastructure.  It took several months of intense preparation on both sides (adapting the boxes, portals, interfaces and information systems, connecting SFR shops to the wire-line network, etc.) to launch the “Box TV Fibre” offer on 18 November 2014, just a few days after the Autorité de la concurrence had cleared the merger (30 October). Generalised strategic information exchanges Before the merger was cleared, Altice and SFR exchanged large quantities of strategic information in readiness for the integration of the two groups. This information was confidential and concerned individualised data, SFR's recent commercial performance and forecasts for the coming months. The exchanges involved the most senior executives of both groups. THE ALTICE-OTL MERGER Intervention by Altice in OTL's operational management Before the merger was cleared, Altice had to make a number of strategic decisions on behalf of OTL, based on certain clauses in the memorandum of understanding signed to define the conditions of the merger. These decisions concerned, in particular, agreements to host OTL's mobile customers with network operators. Strategic information exchanges  Altice set up a weekly information reporting mechanism allowing it to keep close track of OTL's economic performance. This monitoring, which is comparable to that exercised by a controlling shareholder, provided Altice with access to commercially sensitive information concerning OTL.  Premature assignment of management duties Lastly, the Autorité observed that OTL's Managing Director had begun to carry out his duties within the SFR-Numericable group before the merger had been cleared and, in particular, was involved in SFR's new commercial projects and received commercially sensitive information. A 80 MILLION EUROS FINE In view of the above behaviour, which characterises gun jumping, the Autorité de la concurrence has fined jointly Altice Luxembourg and SFR Group 80 million euros. The fine, which is particularly heavy compared with those handed out by the Autorité in previous cases of failure to give notification and comply with commitments, takes into account:  the scale of the transactions concerned by the breach, both in terms of the amount of the acquisitions and the impact on the telecoms sector; the extent and combination of the various types of behaviour that led to gun jumping in both mergers, some of which were directly connected to the competition risks precisely identified by the Autorité in its clearance decision; the scale of SFR's and Virgin Mobile's activities directly concerned by the behaviour; the duration of the behaviour, which began before the mergers were notified and continued throughout the merger control procedure; the observation of similar behaviour by Altice for the two mergers notified in 2014 and of the deliberate nature of the behaviour concerned. Noteworthy precedents in Europe and elsewhere in the world include the Gemstar case in the United States in 2003 (a 5 million euros fine), the Mars/Nutro case in Germany in 2008 (fines worth 4.5 million euros), the European Commission Electrabel case in 2009 (fines worth 20 million euros) and the Cisco Systems Inc/Technicolor case in Brazil in 2016 (fines worth some 8 million euros). > See note on mergers in the press release > Decision 16-D-24 regarding the situation of the Altice group with regard to Section II of Article L.430-8 will be published at a later date on the Autorité de la concurrence's website > Press contact: Chloé Duretête / Tel.: +33 (0)1 55 04 01 20 / Mel ",

It also orders a number of injunctions subject to periodic penalty payments. Background Autorité de la concurrence Decision 14-DCC-160 of 30 October 2014 see the press release of 27 October 2014       Among these risks, the Autorité considered that the operation was liable to undermine Numericable-SFR 's incentive to honour its commitments to the Public Authorities and its co-investors (mainly Orange and Bouygues Telecom) with regard to the deployment of optical fibre. The Autorité noted that Bouygues Telecom was most likely to be affected, given its contractual ties with SFR in the so-called \"Faber contract\" for co-investment in optical fibre infrastructure in high-density areas These commitments were aimed at preventing the new entity from suspending the completion of these connections in high-density areas.        The Autorité de la concurrence has observed that they have not been met: the pace of the connections slowed noticeably after completion of the operation, and has only really resumed after a year, running substantially behind the agreed schedule. Moreover, this non-compliance was accompanied by a deterioration in the network maintenance conditions, which penalised Bouygues Telecom. The Autorité has handed down a fine of 40 million euros, together with injunctions designed to oblige the operator to meet its commitments. There are also provisions for periodic penalty payments per concentration point and per day late. THE SO-CALLED \"FABER\" CO-INVESTMENT CONTRACT SIGNED BY SFR AND BOUYGUES TELECOM The deployment of optical fibre, which should eventually replace the copper network is a major industrial and economic challenge. It offers consumers and businesses very high-speed Internet using, at the moment, two types of network: - upgraded coaxial cable, in optical fibre, to the foot of the building (FttB, Fibre to the Building), owned exclusively by Altice/SFR Group, ex-Numericable; - optical fibre to the home (FttH, Fibre to the Home), currently being deployed by the telecom operators. On 9 November 2010, Bouygues Telecom and SFR signed a co-investment agreement to deploy a horizontal optical fibre network in the main French cities, located in high-density areas, within the meaning of the French Telecommunications and Posts Regulator (ARCEP) regulations. The contract concerns 22 municipalities, including Paris. While the Faber contract is based on the principle of sharing the costs and investments between the parties, it is nevertheless led by SFR, which acts on both operators' behalves to carry out the deployment, including the services involved in the connections , as well as the maintenance of the shared infrastructure. The deployment operations involve horizontal deployment of the FttH network to the street near buildings (i.e. to the \"connection point\") and installation of the \"last leg\" connecting the network to the buildings. In practice, connection consists in laying cables (circled in green on the diagram) to link the \"horizontal\" network to the \"vertical\" network (shown in blue on the diagram) already installed in the building by the \"building operator\" From a technical point of view, the connection is made at the building's \"concentration point\" (BCP), generally situated at the foot of the building either inside, or outside the building, according to the cases predefined by ARCEP.

The Autorité considered that the operation was liable to undermine SFR's incentive to honour its commitments to its co-investors to deploy optical fibre, insofar as the operator would have little incentive to pursue its co-investment efforts in FttH networks throughout the area in which upgraded cable could provide data speeds on a par with fibre ; a significant part of FttH outlets that SFR was planning to deploy in very high-density areas would be redundant with Numericable's cable network after the operation.  The Autorité noted that Bouygues Telecom could be particularly impacted, given the contractual ties established with SFR under the Faber contract. On the eve of Numericable's acquisition of SFR, Bouygues Telecom had already co-financed significant horizontal deployments of optic fibre through the contract. However, SFR had completed the connection for a very small number of these homes, preventing Bouygues Télécom from benefiting from its investments. THE COMMITMENTS MADE BY ALTICE AND NUMERICABLE To overcome the competition issues identified by the Autorité , the new entity made the following commitments: 1) To connect buildings with access to vertical fibre to the horizontal optical fibre network for the geographic scope covered by the Faber contract ; For buildings already connected to vertical fibre by building operators at the date of the authorisation decision (\"stock\"), the new Altice-SFR Group was to connect them within two years , barring duly justified connection problems. For buildings which would be connected to fibre by the building operator following the authorisation decision (\"flow\"), Altice-SFR Group was to connect the buildings ordered by Bouygues Telecom each quarter, again barring duly justified connection problems, within three months . This requirement had been set in consideration of the regulations, which impose a three month \"consideration\" period on building operators before any marketing of fibre packages to residents of homes connected. Thus ensuring equal opportunities for other operators and preventing the operator who connected the building to the fibre network from pre-empting the market. 2) Ensure transparent, non-discriminatory network maintenance Altice/SFR Group had undertaken to maintain the infrastructure per the conditions laid down in the contract, in a transparent, non-discriminatory manner with regard to Bouygues Telecom, to allow the latter to fully leverage the network it had co-financed. FAILURE TO HONOUR COMMITMENTS  1) Processing time for connections not respected It appears that Altice/SFR Group has failed to honour its commitments, notably by connecting fewer concentration points than it was supposed, having estimated that these “excluded” concentration points weren't part of the commitments' scope. Between 12% and 19% of the required connections have been left out of the scope of the commitments.  In total , over half of the planned connections (58%) were not carried out.  For the \"stock\", two years after the decision, only one-third of the connections have been carried out, the other connections that were attempted being classified as “definitive failure”. While Altice/-SFR Group has pointed to technical problems to account for the unsuccessful attempts to carry out the connections, it has not provided any precise explanation for the difficulties encountered, nor taken the necessary steps to solve them.    For the \"flow\", only half of the buildings that Bouygues wanted to connect have actually been connected, without Altice/-SFR providing any precise documentation of the difficulties met. The three-month period that Altice/SFR Group should have adhered to was only very partially respected, leaving the way free for competing operators to pre-empt prospective customers . 2)  Degraded maintenance Information on file shows that the time taken to deal with the incidents that occurred was manifestly excessive, regarding in particular the standards specified in the contract. It also appears that Altice/SFR Group failed to take the necessary steps to provide efficient maintenance, especially to address certain technical facilities (absence of air conditioning), resulting in service interruptions for subscribers. The Autorité notes that the deterioration in the quality of the FttH network pursuant to the Faber contract was mainly detrimental to Bouygues Telecom because, after the decision to take over SFR, Altice/SFR had adopted a new strategy consisting in only marketing offers using modernized cable network in areas in which it had both this network and an optical fibre network. A € 40 MILLION FINE For two years, from the date of the Autorité decision to authorise the acquisition of SFR subject to certain conditions to the decision made today, Altice/SFR Group has only very partially fulfilled its commitments and has not taken steps to meet them properly. Altice/SFR Group, which is a powerful group with substantial resources for economic and legal analyses, could not have been unaware of the binding nature of the commitments or the consequences of its behaviour on the state of competition in ultra-fast broadband, and especially on that of its co-contractor. By refraining from carrying out the connections to which it was committed, it deprived Bouygues Telecom of the possibility of marketing fibre packages to the homes concerned. This weakened Bouygues Telecom's position at a time when it was an active competitor on the high-speed and very high-speed Internet sector.  The Autorité has accordingly fined Altice/SFR Group 40 million euros. It has also pronounced a number of injunctions to ensure that Altice/SFR Group refrains from pursuing these practices. More specifically, it has drawn up a new calendar for Altice/SFR Group, with successive stages of completion and progressive periodic penalty payments to force the group to carry out the connection of all of the concentration points not yet connected. Accordingly, Altice/SFR Group must have connected all of the concentration points (within the “stock” and the “flow”) within 12 months, barring duly justified connection problems . An independent representative will be appointed to monitor the maintenance conditions and progress with the connections, and will submit a report to the Autorité every three months on the progress of carrying out the injunctions. Injunctions subject to a periodic penalty payment  By pronouncing injunctions subject to periodic penalty payment, the Autorité de la concurrence is applying for the first time, the provisions of the Law of 6 August 2015 for growth, activity and equality of economic opportunities (also known as the Macron Law), which gives it additional means should the commitments taken in the framework of a merger operation fail to be fulfilled. In June 2016, Numericable-SFR adopted the business name SFR-Group. The regulations oblige the building operator (i.e. the operator who connected the building to the fibre network) to wait at least three months before activating any FttH access in the homes concerned, to allow third-party operators to carry out the connection in this period (the so-called \"J3M\" obligation, for \"day + 3 months\"). > See the full text of Decision 17-D-04 of 8 March 2017 regarding compliance with the agreement in the decision authorizing the acquisition of SFR by the Altice group, regarding the agreement with Bouygues Telecom of 9 November 2010 > Press contact: Chloé Duretête / Tel. : +33 (0)1 55 04 01 20 / Email > See decision of the Conseil d'Etat (28th September 2017)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines ENGIE 100 million euros for abusing its dominant position by using in particular its historical data file to convert its customers  on regulated gas tariffs to market-based contracts for gas and electricity. Furthermore, in another case regarding ENGIE pricing practices for market-based gas contracts,  it is submitting to public consultation the commitments proposed by ENGIE to resolve the problems identified by the Autorité. In Brief Autorité de la concurrence In particular, ENGIE used its file of customers eligible for regulated tariffs on gas ( Tarifs réglementés de vente du gaz - TRV), which it holds in its capacity as the incumbent operator, as well as its dedicated TRV business infrastructure to sell its market-price gas and electricity supply contracts to private individuals and small business customers. ENGIE also used a misleading selling point to consumers, according to which it guaranteed a better security of gas supply than its competitors in order to incite customers to choose its contracts. ENGIE did not contest the facts, but wished to make a deal with the Autorité , which set the sum of the fine at 100,000,000 euros. It should be remembered that the decision on the merits issued today was preceded, on 9 September 2014, by an interim decision ( see press release ), substantially upheld by the Paris Court of Appeal, under the terms of which ENGIE was required to share part of its client database with its competitors so that they would be able to compete on an equal footing with the incumbent operator in markets open to competition.        The responsibilities of former monopoly holders in competitive markets The Autorité drew attention, in this case, on the principles applicable in the event of diversification of monopolies or incumbent former monopoly holders in the relevant markets in competitive sectors. It is in particular lawful, for a company in a dominant market position as a result of a legal monopoly, to enter one or more markets in competitive sectors. However, this in on condition that the company concerned does not abuse its dominant position for the purpose of restricting or attempting to restrict access to the market by its competitors using means other than competition on merits.  Where practices concern not only a diversification, but a continuation of business by an operator in a dominant position on a market as a result of a former legal monopoly, in a market opened up to competition, the operator concerned must be careful to avoid any abusive use of resources that cannot be employed by newcomers entering the market opened to competition at a reasonable cost and within acceptable periods of time, given the particular responsibility of the original operator in this market. ENGIE used resources inherited from its former status as the incumbent supplier to sell market-based contracts When the gas and electricity retail markets were opened to competition, ENGIE used the resources that it held as a result of its former state monopoly  gas supplier selling at the regulated selling price (TRV) to market its market-based gas and electricity contracts to consumers.  Use of TRV customer historical data file ENGIE used the information from its TRV subscriber database, which gathered almost all French gas customers (11 million in 2007), to facilitate selling of its market-based contracts. Use of the data began as soon as the gas market was opened to competition in 2004 for non-residential customers (small businesses) and 2007 for residential customers (individuals) Use of the TRV business structure These market-based gas and electricity contracts were marketed using the same business infrastructure and resources developed for its TRV gas supply activity. It thus profited from contacts with TRV customers in order to offer them market-based contracts (cross-selling) It also tried to win back former TRV customers that had changed supplier (customer winbacks) in order to offer them its market-based contracts. A misleading sales pitch At the end of 2013, the company claimed in marketing that the security of supply for its gas contracts would be superior to that offered by its competitors. However, this selling point is misleading because it in no way reflects the reality of the gas market, in which all suppliers are indeed subject to the same supply obligations. Therefore, the ENGIE customers are no more and no less affected by gas shortages in the event of a major disruption to the national gas supply. This argument is likely to have had a potential effect on the market by dissuading some consumers from leaving ENGIE for a different gas supplier.   Practices implemented in the special context of a market opening up to competition These various practices, which are cumulative, based on use by ENGIE of its advantages resulting from its activity as a public utility supplying gas at the regulated selling price (TRV) and in some cases, impossible to copy under reasonable cost and time, have resulted in confusion between its activity as a public utility and its competitive activity selling gas and electricity supply contracts at market price. These practices took place at a time when the market was characterised, on one hand, by a very low level of consumer knowledge (almost 1 in 2 people did not know that they could change gas supplier ) and, on the other hand, by the advantageous reputation and good image of ENGIE (a large majority of small non-residential consumers are unable to spontaneously name a competitor ). Amongst other things the practices concerned were implemented when the gas market was in the process of opening up to competition, i.e. at a sensitive period during which an incumbent operator had the advantage of a significant market power whilst new market entrants were in a phase of development.  Nevertheless, in this context, ENGIE may not have been immediately aware of its obligations under the specific conditions of its situation. Uncertainty regarding this matter may, under the circumstances of the case, be considered as a factor mitigating the severity of some of the practices identified.  Consequently, given the information and the settlement procedure requested by ENGIE, which is not contesting the facts, the Autorité, has imposed a fine of 100,000,000 euros.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité has imposed sanctions totalling €302 million on the three leading manufacturers of PVC and linoleum floor covering, as a penalty for price fixing among other pratices.   Background  Autorité Autorité Syndicat Français des Enducteurs Calandreurs et Fabricants de Revêtements de Sols et Murs Autorité Autorité Products concerned by the agreement Manufacturers met secretly to, in particular, discuss prices Secret meetings at hotels in Paris and provincial France Over a period extending from late 2001 until 2011, the three main manufacturers of floor coverings in France, Forbo, Gerflor and Tarkett met in secret at so-called \"1, 2, 3\" meetings, at which they notably discussed minimum prices for products and price increases for all their products that would be passed on to their respective customers, as well as multiple issues relating to their sales strategy over time.  For example, regarding generalised price increases, the three competitors would discuss percentage price increases for each category of floor covering, which would vary slightly between manufacturers. They would also discuss implementation dates for such increases, which might be either staggered or simultaneous, and decided which company would be the first to notify its customers of the price increase.  A manager with Forbo explained the mechanism for agreeing on minimum prices as follows: \"(…) The idea was not to organise our market shares but to define a differentiation between the prices of our products that would not be detrimental to us from a sales & marketing perspective. As a rule, we observed the minimum prices agreed with Gerflor and Tarkett (…). \" (see §94 of the Decision)   \"In setting minimum prices, our goal was to maintain the lowest prices at a certain level. (…)\" (see §99 of the Decision) The CEO of Tarkett France explained the meaning of these discussions: \"(…) we had an agreement not to discount below those minimum prices, which were largely equivalent across Forbo, Gerflor and Tarkett.\" (§97) \"However, the three manufacturers' minimum prices had to avoid being completely identical. We therefore ensured that our prices differed by at least a few euro cents: plus or minus 10 cents for premium products, and plus or minus 2 to 3 cents for entry-level products. \" (§98) The manufacturers also entered into agreement regarding a series of specific issues, such as strategies to adopt with regard to particular customers or competitors, customer relationship management, hiring policy, organisation of sales activities, and sampling of new products. Initially, these meetings, hosted by each participant in turn, were held on the sidelines of official meetings of the SFEC, or in a café near the industry association's offices. Later, they were held in hotels or restaurants in Paris and elsewhere in France (see § 63 of the decision). The Novotel hotel in Charenton-le-Pont and the Novotel near the Gare de Lyon in Paris were among the venues chosen to host these \"1, 2, 3\" meetings. The documentary evidence relating to the case (bank statements, hotel and restaurant bills, toll tickets, diaries, etc.) establishes a record of about 30 meetings, which provided a framework for the anticompetitive agreement, excluding the meetings on specific issues (17 on client relationship).  A sophisticated system of telephone discussions In addition to these secret meetings, the companies' CEOs and Sales Directors used nine dedicated telephone lines to hold confidential discussions. Tarkett described this covert telephone system as follows: Each participant at the \" 1, 2, 3\" meetings was \" issued with a phone with a package contracted by a competitor, such that all calls were made between two phones belonging to the same company. In practice, everyone had two phones: one from their own company and one with a package contracted by another manufacturer (… ) \" (§ 78 of the decision). Confidential information exchanged via the SFEC Forbo, Gerflor and Tarkett also exchanged, in the context of official meetings of the SFEC, very precise information relating to trading volumes, revenues per product category and sales forecasts. The trade association played an active role in these discussions. It received this information from its members, including the three manufacturers, and passed on their respective declarations in full.  Through very frequent discussions (at quarterly and annual meetings) of their positions and sales on the market, companies were able to more accurately assess their market situation and adapt their sales policy and strategy accordingly.  On this topic, the Chairman of the Management Board of Forbo stated: \" these discussions helped participants to better understand the market and its stakeholders, and to more effectively assess changes in their own market share, etc. They helped to inform changes to companies' own sales or marketing strategies. \" (§ 353) Successive CEOs of Tarkett France stressed that \" the aim was to identify our respective market shares in order to understand our position, analyse our strengths and weaknesses and adapt our strategy and sales policy in the light of the results. \" (§ 355) This perspective was corroborated by Gerflor: \" The goal was to gauge ourselves against the competition and determine the market trends for particular products. Knowing the market shares of our competitors enabled us to know whose market share we had conquered, which was useful\". (§ 352) \"For example, that enabled us to implement a product policy to adapt to the market . \" (§ 356) As the anticompetitive nature of these exchanges gradually became apparent, their format was changed to make them less easily to detect. Initially sent by email, this information was subsequently communicated in hardcopy format and eventually simply presented by the trade association at meetings, without being disseminated in hard copies. These practices, which began during the 1990's, ceased only in the wake of the raids conducted by the Autorité in 2013. A non-competition agreement relating to environmental communication  Forbo, Gerflor and Tarkett, together with the trade association, also produced and signed a charter barring each company from advertising the individual environmental performance of its products. Manufacturers were permitted only to communicate on the environmental performance of their product through joint data sheets produced by the trade association. According to the terms of the charter, the effect of this agreement was to eliminate \"competitive marketing practices based on environmental characteristics\" and \" avoid unnecessary controversy relating to particular products and adopt a consistent marketing approach\" in order to prevent \"reckless green marketing. \" Leroy Merlin received a blunt refusal to its requestregarding volatile organic compound (VOC) releases by product, which it wanted to provide to customers. The SFEC sent a letter to Leroy Merlin on 21 December 2009, explaining \" at this stage, we consider it sufficient to identify for customers any products that exceed the requirements of incoming French regulations by a factor of two (…) going further, in view of the prevailing level of knowledge and understanding of atmospheric emissions, would not provide them with any added value \" (§ 402). Tradesmen, retailers and consumers, increasingly sensitive to the debate surrounding the impact of air quality on human health, specifically as a result of releases from PVC floor coverings, could not receive the standard of information that might have prevailed in the absence of this agreement, and might have enlighten their purchasing decisions. Furthermore, this agreement may have acted as a disincentive to manufacturers to innovate in order to offer their customers products characterised by better environmental performances, thereby impacting a product differentiation factor. These practices persisted from 2002 to 2011. Grave practices impeding effective competition By fixing prices, price changes, increases and various aspects of their sales strategies, Forbo, Gerflor and Tarkett, which over the period from 2001 until 2012 accounted for between 65% and 85% of the market, depending on the distribution channel (\"Building trade\" and \"Consumer\"), affected several key competition factors, leading the aforementioned companies to operate in the market other than they normally would. By exchanging confidential strategic information, falling under business secrecy, a practice they knew to be illegal, they were able to adapt and adjust their sales policies.  Lastly, the non-competition agreement relating to communication of environmental information may have served as a disincentive to improve technical performance and to innovate as a means of improving the environmental quality of their products. In determining the applicable sanctions, the Autorité considered not only the severity of the practices but also their widespread, institutionalised nature and long duration, involving senior management at the various companies. The Autorité also considered the willingness by all entities to reach a settlement. Lastly, two companies (Forbo and Tarkett) submitted applications for leniency, resulting in substantially reduced penalties in recognition of their major contributions to the investigation. Consequently, the Autorité has imposed the following fines:  Organisation or company Penalty amount The leniency procedure enables companies participating or which have participated in an anticompetitive agreement, to reveal the existence thereof to the Autorité and obtain, subject to certain conditions, the benefit of a full or partial exemption from financial penalties, depending on factors such as the order in which they contacted the Autorité, the added value of the contributed evidence and their cooperation with the inquiry. > More information on the leniency procedure . > See the full text of the decision 17-D-20 of 18 October 2017 regarding practices implemented in the hardwearing floor coverings sector > Press contact : Chloé Duretête 01 55 04 01 20 / Email  ",

The “Lurel Act” bans any exclusive import agreement  The Overseas Economic Regulations Act of 20 November 2012, known as the “Lurel Act” banned unjustified exclusive importing into overseas collectivities as from 22 March 2013. In its decision, the Autorité found that Materne (which markets desserts under the same name and also under the Pom'Potes, Confipote and Mont Blanc brand names) and Établissements Frédéric Legros still had an exclusive distribution agreement in La Réunion and Mayotte after 22 March 2013 and continued to implement this illegal agreement until 5 July 2016.

Background In late 2015, Direct Énergie made a referral to the Autorité de la concurrence to report, among other things, Engie's pricing practices concerning its market offers, which, in its opinion, were liable to be anticompetitive.  In May 2016, the Autorité considered that Engie was likely to have set the prices of its individual market offers, i.e. tailored offers, for businesses without consideration of its real costs, at the risk of implementing predatory or exclusionary pricing.   Pending its decision on the merits, the Autorité urgently required Engie to comply with various measures in order that the prices of the offers in question better reflect the reality of its costs. Competition concerns As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the services of the Autorité considered that, given the evidence gathered, it could not be ruled out that the prices of many offers for both consumers and businesses did not allow Engie, which leads the market, to cover its costs. Further, the evidence in the case show that Engie was not reliably determining its costs and therefore its prices, and nor was it performing reliable monitoring of the profitability of its offers. Furthermore, individual metering and gas service contracts with co-owners associations contained clauses that were likely to be anticompetitive, such as excessive contract terms (10 years), prohibitive cancellation fees, or the interdiction to use energy sources other than gas for heating and hot water. Engie's commitments will ensure that its pricing policy reflects its real costs. In return, Engie requested a commitment procedure and proposed measures to the Autorité to address the competition problems identified. After consulting the market and making several amendments, the Autorité accepted the commitments. The tariff commitments made (implementation of a cost definition method and a reliable profitability analysis of market offers) will ensure that the company implements an internal process to determine and verify the profitability of its market offers, using a relevant and verifiable cost structure, in accordance with the established principles of competition law. Commitments relating to contracts concluded with co-owners associations (including contract term reduced to 5 years and possibility of cancelling at no cost, or releasing co-owners associations from the obligation to use gas for heating and hot water), will enable clients to capitalise on competition for gas supply contracts reasonably quickly, and allow them to consider other energy sources for heating and hot water. An independent trustee will be responsible for ensuring that the commitments are implemented and complied with, and will report to the Autorité . Considering that these commitments address the competition problems identified by enabling better competition on the retail gas supply and individual metering for collective supply markets, the Autorité has made them mandatory and closing the proceedings brought before it.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Following a referral by the pharmaceutical laboratory Ratiopharm , now Teva Santé, the Autorité de la concurrence has today issued a decision imposing a fine of 25 million euros on Janssen-Cilag and its parent company Johnson & Johnson for having delayed the arrival to the market of a generic version of the Durogesic and for then blocking the development of this generic medicinal product. Durogesic is a powerful opioid analgesic, with the active ingredient fentanyl, prescribed for treatment of severe pain. It is provided to patients with chronic cancer pain, including children.. It is prescribed in the form of a patch to be applied to the skin. Two practices led to the imposition of the fine:  - repeated legally, and unjustified, approaches of Janssen-Cilag, to the AFSSAPS (the French agency for medical safety of health products ), with the aim of convincing the health authority to refuse to grant, at a national level, generic status to competing medicinal products from the Durogesic , despite this status being obtained at European level. - implementation by Janssen-Cilag of a major campaign falsely disparaging the generic versions of Durogesic among office- and hospital-based healthcare professionals (doctors, pharmacists) using misleading language to create doubt in their minds concerning the effectiveness and safety of these generic medicinal products.   These are grave practices. They have delayed the arrival to the market of generic medicines by several months and have discredited the generic versions of Durogesic, irrespective of any consideration of public health, by creating doubt in the minds of healthcare professionals regarding their effectiveness and safety. The strategy implemented by Janssen-Cilag had large-scale effects targeting all the healthcare professionals likely to prescribe or dispense Durogesic and generated a loss of income for the generic medicinal product laboratories in a context marked by chronic deficits in their corporate accounts. 1.LEGALLY UNJUSTIFIED APPROACH BY JANSSEN-CILAG TO THE FRENCH HEALTH AUTHORITY Following the issue of a marketing authorisation (AMM) by Germany for its generic medicinal product, Ratiopharm instigated a mutual recognition procedure, as allowed under European legislation, with the aim of obtaining a marketing authorisation in the member countries of the European Union - including France - where it wished to distribute its medicinal product. The European Commission granted this marketing authorisation in October 2007 and ordered the member countries to comply with it within 30 days. However, Janssen Cilag interfered unduly in the national procedure for issuing the marketing authorisation with an objective to delay the arrival to the market of generic medicines.  • Repeated unjustified approaches by Janssen Cilag to the AFSSAPS  During the procedure to issue marketing authorisation to generic versions of the Durogesic, Janssen-Cilag wrote, on multiple occasions, to the AFSSAPS, and requested the organisation of a meeting with it. During these exchanges, the laboratory called the decision of the European Commission into question and suggesting that the AFSSAPS was able to make a different decision from the one made at the European level, whereas the Commission's decision was in fact legally imposed on the French agency. In order to convince the AFSSAPS, the laboratory questioned the quality of the generic medicinal products in competition with Durogesic, in particular questioning the bioequivalence, despite it having been established, and the existence of differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition of the active ingredient, fentanyl.  It proposed in a letter that Durogesic and its generic counterparts were not “exactly similar”. In an account sent to the AFSSAPS, Janssen-Cilag even went as far as questioning the whole class of generic medicinal products by indicating that “ the system in place does not offer all the necessary safety provisions ” and that reasons of cost led the laboratories to “ look for sources of supply outside the European Union, involving countries that do not always offer the required guarantees of quality (e.g. Asia)”  It also put forward risks for public health that this substitution could cause in some patients: ineffectiveness or adverse effects triggering an increase in pain. Janssen Cilag proposed that the substitution could generate “ineffectiveness or unexpected adverse effects among some types of patients (elderly or frail)”, (...) “ Any substitution used for children could cause similar or even worse problems\" •  An extremely long marketing authorisation for the generic medicinal products   The AFSSAPS, being aware of the alarmist arguments presented by Janssen-Cilag, and having responsibility for guaranteeing health safety, initially refused to recognise the generic status of the medicinal products in competition with Durogesic even though it had no margin for manoeuvre to ask as such, in view of the Decision by the European Commission. In a letter sent by the AFSSAPS to Ratiopharm, the health agency justified the refusal to grant the generic status to the medicinal product, by stating that “ the quantity of active principle contained in a patch [the Ratiopharm medicinal products] is not the same as that contained in a patch of the reference product Durogesic (…)”. The objective that Janssen-Cilag had set in 2005 at an internal meeting of a group called “Team ANTI-Génériques Durogesic®”, was achieved. It was only at the end of 2008, more than a year after the Commission decision, that the AFSSAPS granted generic status to the competing medicinal products from the Durogesic, with a warning attached to this authorisation, recommending careful medical monitoring of certain patients (those with fever, elderly patients and children) in the event of changing between fentanyl-based medicinal products. 2. AN ORGANISED GLOBAL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTING TO DISCREDIT COMPETING MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FROM THE DUROGESIC • Mass communication with healthcare professionals After the marketing authorisation for the transdermal fentanyl, Janssen-Cilag used various means to deliver a message extensively to hospital and office-based doctors and pharmacists, denigrating the competing medicinal products from the Durogesic, presenting them as generics that are not like the others. This message emphasised the differences in the quantity of the active ingredient contained, between the various patches, as well as their size difference. The originator laboratory recommended that its medical sales representatives should emphasise that the generic patches “ do not have the same composition, nor the same quantity of fentanyl nor the same size as the Durogesic® patch”. Janssen-Cilag thus suggested that the procedure for granting the marketing authorisation to generic medicinal products would not be sufficiently protective of the health and safety of patients, by insisting in particular on the ligntened nature of the files provided as they were containing only the bioequivalence studies. To convey this message, 300 medical sales representatives, designated as “commandos” were trained. A medical newsletter was distributed extensively to all doctors, and office- and hospital-based pharmacists by post, e-mail, fax and in the specialist press. Distance training and telephone calls from doctors to dispensing pharmacists were added to the strategy. The implementation of the above actions has been confirmed by many testimonies: During the investigation, the following statement was taken from one pharmacy, located in Paris: “when the generic came out, the laboratory called us to advise us to continue with Durogesic® for treatments that had already been started using this product (and not to change over to the generic) (…) The laboratory producing Durogesic® also offered us training at the time of release of the generics like Durogesic®. This training covered the product, how it was to be dispensed, etc.\" The pharmacy in a shopping centre in Lyon stated: “We received the visit from Janssen-Cilag at the time of release of the generic. The person who came (…) advised us not to dispense the generic. \" The head pharmacist at the Roanne medical centre stated that the medical sales representatives from Janssen-Cilag informed him during one visit of “the arrival of competitor products (Nycomed, Ratiopharm) that were “not generic” and therefore “unable to be used as a substitute”. • Misuse of the AFSSAPS warning The laboratory distorted the content of the warning issued by the AFSSAPS by providing an inaccurate and incomplete presentation of the risks associated with substitution, thus conveying an alarmist message to the healthcare professionals. The AFSSAPS also sent a letter to Janssen-Cilag, in order to correct the inaccuracies in the letter sent to the pharmacists because certain phrases “ did not accurately reflect the content of the position held by the AFSSAPS ”. In the “ medical newsletter ”, Janssen Cilag emphasised the risk associated with replacement of the originator medicinal product with the generic version, whereas the warning provided by the AFSSAPS made no distinction between substitution either way (“ reference medicinal product replaced by generic version, generic medicinal product replaced by reference medicinal product or generic medicinal product replaced by generic medicinal product ”). In addition, the warning listed specific risks of changing treatment for certain categories of patients (patients with fever, elderly patients and children), whilst stating that these risks could be eliminated by medical monitoring. Yet the laboratory did not specify the categories of patients nor did it state that monitoring could be implemented. On the contrary, it suggested that any change of fentanyl patch during treatment could entail a particular risk, and was therefore to be avoided.  “ Please do not change from one patch to another during treatment”, as “a patient who has started treatment with Durogesic® should preferably continue to use Durogesic®” or even “ensure that there is no change in the brand of fentanyl patch during treatment”  Screensavers installed on doctors' computers also mentioned a “special” warning, showing the text of the warning surrounded by some triangular signs indicating the presence of a danger. Lastly, Janssen-Cilag emphasised the allegedly exceptional nature of the warning applied by the AFSSAPS, whereas this option had only been introduced into the public health code a short time beforehand. These statements generated an extensive response among healthcare professionals. The result was that doctors and pharmacists were reluctant to dispense the generic medicinal products, for fear that it would engage their liability: A cancer specialist in practice in Lille pointed out: “ The sales representative warned me of the risk for patients (…) the message from these representatives was very forceful. They applied pressure to get their message over. This message was attempting to make me feel guilty, for example suggesting that the patients that I might prescribe the generic for would be overwhelmed by pain” (refs 38720 and 38721 ). A pharmacy, in Lyon, stated: “ We had received a message about the lower effectiveness of the generic [of Durogesic®] and were not inclined to change. All the more so because the prescriptions showed the note “non substitutable'' This misleading presentation sparked serious concerns among healthcare professionals, generating an even more extensive, response as there is still a certain reluctance from them towards generic medicinal products, which can be possibly explained by the lack of awareness regarding the marketing authorisation procedure, by a poor assessment of the regulatory framework on substitution and by their desire to guard against the risks that could engage their civil or legal liability. Grave practices, on a large scale, which have taken a toll on corporate accounts The practices applied by Janssen-Cilag are grave. They delayed the arrival to the market of generic medicinal products and restricted their growth.  With its repeated interventions to the AFSSAPS, Janssen-Cilag managed to delay the marketing authorisation procedure for the competing medicinal products from the Durogesic by several months, as well as the recognition of their status of generic medicinal products. The originator laboratory could thus unduly benefit from its longer monopoly situation in the concerned markets. During this period, the foreclosure effect on competitors from the Durogesic was almost absolute, by making the marketing of competing generic medicinal products from the Durogesic impossible, generating a loss of income for the generic medicinal product laboratories in a context marked by chronic deficits in their corporate accounts. The smear campaign implemented by the office- and hospital-based healthcare professionals was vast, as shown by the target audiences affected:  - 12,800 pharmacies were affected by the peer-to-peer discussions, in other words just over half of French pharmacies. - 83 % of pharmacists asked by Janssen-Cilag, as part of a study evaluating the effects of its campaign, had memorised “ the risks associated with changing between fentanyl-based medicinal products ”; - 12,000 GPs have the screensaver, in particular.  This smear campaign, implemented between 2008 and 2009, contributed to the low penetration rate of the generic medicinal products from the Durogesic, by amplifying the effects of the warning adopted by the AFSSAPS, participating in the decision of the public authorities to impose, in January 2011, a a flat-rate liability price  after observing that the substitution targets had not been achieved. Janssen-Cilag itself had not anticipated such a low substitution rate as that seen. Consequently, the Autorité has imposed a fine of 25 million euros against Janssen Cilag and its parent company Johnson & Johnson.   Ratiopharm had also requested the ordering of interim measures. The Autorité refused this request, considering that the necessary conditions had not been met, but had decided to pursue an investigation into the merits of the case. In 2015, Teva withdrew their request. The AFSSAPS has since become ANSM (national agency for safety of medicines and health products). The flat-rate liability price is used to impose a single nominal sum for reimbursement for originator and generic medicinal products alike, freeing the dispensing pharmacist from his obligation to replace the originator medicinal product with the generic version  As a reminder, the Autorité has previously already applied penalties for defamatory practices against pharmaceutical laboratories In 2013, the Autorité de la Concurrence fined the Sanofi-Aventis laboratory 40.6 million euros for having implemented a strategy discrediting the generic versions of Plavix® ( see press release of 14 May 2013 ). In the same year, the Autorité de la Concurrence fined the Schering-Plough pharmaceutical laboratory 15.3 million euros for having hindered the arrival of the generic version of its originator medicinal product Subutex® ( see press release of 19 December 2013 ).

These behaviours have hampered the progress of the investigation of the case, preventing it from coming to fruition: the concerned practices have not, to this day, led to a decision on the merits of the case by the Autorité . Obstructing an investigation is subject to a monetary penalty When a company obstructs an investigation, by giving incomplete or incorrect information for instance, or by disclosing incomplete or defaced documents, the Autorité can, upon request from the General Rapporteur, and after having heard the company in question and the government commissioner, decide to impose a monetary penalty. Its amount can reach 1% of the company's global turnover. A serious breach which hinders the Autorité's mission to preserve the economic public order The investigation services of the Autorité encountered increasing difficulties to cooperate with Brenntag. First, the company provided incomplete, imprecise and out of delay information before refusing to provide information and material elements (notably invoices and account records) which it had been asked for several times.  The Autorité considers that this behaviour is especially serious. The extent to which information was withheld by Brenntag prevented the investigation services from comprehending the market function or assessing the nature of the plaintiffs' allegations. The amount of the fine also takes into account the size of the company and the necessity to ensure an effect dissuasive enough to prevent a company from objectively benefiting from obstructing an investigation by the Autorité .  It is the first time that the Autorité de la concurrence has applied this provision from the French commercial code.   > For more details, see the full text of decision 17-D-27 of 21 December 2017, regarding obstruction practices implemented by Brenntag, on the Autorité de la concurrence website > Press Contact :  Chloé Duretête- 01 55 04 01 20 / Email > This decision was submitted before the cour d'appel de Paris (pending case) ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "In an unprecedented move, the Autorité de la concurrence closes a litigation procedure, and on the same day, clears a merger involving the same activity. The Autorité obtained commitments from La Poste regarding the promotion, commercialization  and valuation of their waste collection offers. It also cleared, subject to conditions, the creation of a full-function joint venture between La Poste and Suez .  Background The Autorité de la concurrence today released a decision in which it accepts the commitments made by La Poste and makes them binding. Further, it makes its clearance of the creation of a full-function joint venture between La Poste and Suez subject to similar commitments.       In both cases, the identified concerns involved, on the one hand, a risk of using competitive advantages that could not be reproduced by competitors, linked to the universal postal service, and on the other hand, price setting by La Poste of offers or services for the collection of non-hazardous office waste at prices below cost.        La Poste committed, firstly, to preventing the confusion of means between its office waste collection and recycling offers and its universal postal service offers, secondly, to establishing and using a methodology for cost assignment for price setting in compliance with competition law, and finally to beginning monitoring profitability.        Suez and La Poste made similar commitments in the framework of a merger control procedure. In view of the concomitance of these two cases, the Autorité took a special interest in guaranteeing the efficiency of the two series of commitments. RECOVERY OF NON-HAZARDOUS OFFICE WASTE FOR RECYCLING The environmental code defines waste as a substance or an object whose owner disposes of or which they wish to or have to dispose. Non-hazardous waste is that which can be processed in the same installations as domestic waste as they are not hazardous (e.g. paper, glass or packaging). It can be produced by households or companies: in the latter case, it is referred to as non-hazardous office waste ( déchets banals d'entreprises (DBE)). Waste management includes two specific steps: collection and management, which can either involve the disposal or the recovery of the waste.  Non-hazardous office waste management should develop in the years to come. In particular, the French Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of 17 August 2015 and its implementing decree create,for companies and public administrations, an obligation to collect and recover such waste at source as well as paper waste from offices separately from the other types. THE LINK BETWEEN THE LITIGATION PROCEDURE AND THE MERGER CONTROL PROCEDURE Since 2011, La Poste has offered collection and recovery of papers from offices, under the Recy'go name. On 19 April 2013, the FEDEREC (Professional federation of recycling companies) lodged a complaint with the Autorité de la concurrence regarding practices implemented by La Poste in this second. To remedy the competition concerns raised by the investigation services, the La Poste group made commitments which were subject to a market test in September 2017 . On the same date (4 September 2017) La Poste and Suez announced their intention to create a full-function joint venture active in the non-hazardous office waste management sector. Facing an unprecented situation, the Autorité de la concurrence analyzed the issues posed by each case in view of the objectives of each procedure. The results of the two analyses led the companies to offer similar commitments in both procedures. The Autorité has endeavored to guarantee the efficiency of the two sets of proposed commitments. It ensured, in particular, that La Poste's commitments under the framework of the litigation decision would not be rendered ineffective by the completion of the merger.   THE COMPETITION ISSUES EXPRESSED In their preliminary assessment, the investigation services identified competition issues regarding the risk of using a competitive advantage that could not be reproduced by competitors linked to the universal postal service. The use of the oath of the mailmen as a confidentiality guarantee and the use of the group's postal clients' existing contacts for the promotion and sale of collection services are especially concerned.  Competition issues concerning pricing practices regarding waste collection services were also identified.  THE ANALYSIS FROM THE AUTORITE IN THE MERGER CONTROL PROCEDURE  The project to create a joint venture is not liable to generate competition problems in the different markets of collecting, managing, recovering and trading in waste, because of the small extent of the overlapping activities between La Poste and Suez and the presence of important operators, some of which are present in several of these markets.  However, the market test (consultation of the sector's stakeholders) carried out under the framework of the merger showed that similar competition issues to those identified by the Autorité de la concurrence in the litigation procedure were liable to occur after the creation of the full-function joint venture. In particular, in view of the position held by La Poste in the different postal services markets: the parties are liable to benefit from competitive advantages linked to the universal postal services that cannot be reproduced; and to use them during the marketing and promotion of the joint venture's services. Additionally, La Poste could provide the joint venture with services necessary to its service offers at prices below the costs that it actually generates. COMMITMENTS ADOPTED BY THE AUTORITE To address the competition concerns, the parties proposed the following commitments: 1. Regarding the litigation procedure Regarding non-tariff aspects, the Groupe La Poste committed to : - Measures to prevent the confusion of means between their waste collection services (non-hazardous office waste) and their universal postal service by : o designing national communications in regard to waste collection services to avoid any confusion with the offers under the universal postal service; o presenting commercial proposals (scoring, invoices) concerning waste collection services on materials avoiding all confusion with the offers under the universal postal service; o setting up awareness-raising programs for staff in contact with clients of the waste collection services; - And more specifically, by : o Deleting all reference to the notion of the swearing-in of mailmen in the devices and materials used for sales promotion of waste collection services; o Not setting up a policy to promote or sell services to clients when they are inquiring services linked to the universal postal service; Regarding tariff aspects, the Groupe La Poste committed to: - Developping a methodology for cost assignment guaranteeing compliance with competition law and valuing the use of the universal postal service for the promotion, marketing and delivery of non-hazardous office waste collection services; - Using this methodology for price determination; - Implementing profitability monitoring. Finally, the Groupe La Poste also committed to establishing, for its staff, specific training on compliance with competition law if confronted by diversification (including tariff aspects for relevant staff). 2. Regarding the merger control procedure To remedy the competition concerns identified during the market test, Suez and La Poste made the same commitments as those presented before, regarding the promotion and marketing of the new company's services. La Poste committed, as far as it is concerned, to regulating its behaviour regarding the promotion and marketing of the joint venture's services and to pricing any services it provides to the full-joint venture at market price, via a cost handling methodology that complies with competition law.

Practices denounced The SICA Madras cooperative and Producteurs agricoles et de la mer associés (PRAMA) association lodged a complaint with the Autorité de la concurrence to denounce the criteria and accession procedure to the Martiniquan inter-professional association for the meat, cattle and milk sector (AMIV). They had also requested interim measures. Accession to the inter-professional association, a required condition for access to European aid and a necessary condition for downstream opportunities The investigation services noted that the accession criteria (effective activity, representativeness and specialization) for AMIV, the only inter-professional association in Martinique in the livestock breeding and meat sector, were neither objective nor transparent and that their application could be discriminatory.  However, belonging to AMIV is a sine qua non condition to qualify for European aid regarding the structuring of livestock farming, which is a vital support in pursuit of profitable meat production activity in Martinique. Accession to the inter-professional association is also very important to enhance the downstream opportunities for Martiniquan breeders.  The accepted commitments In response to these competition concerns, AMIV offered commitments which were subject to consultation (market test) and then further improved them at the request of the Autorité .  AMIV committed to modify the accession procedure and criteria to become an active member of the association (specification of the procedure to file an application, rules for the time limits to examine accession application, obligation to justify its accession acceptance or refusal decisions, specification of the representativeness, activity and specialization criteria). It also committed to create a new active member status, which will enable membership for candidates who desire eligibility for European aid, without participation in the inter-professional activities.  Further, the commitments' structure takes into account the announcement - by the administrations heard during the procedure – of a reform which could soon withdraw AMIV's responsibility to attribute European aid and attribute this responsibility to State's services instead.  These commitments fully respond to the competition concerns of the Autorité which accepted them and made them mandatory. > See the text of Decision 18-D-04 of 21 February 2018 regarding practices implemented in the sector of meat production and sale in Martinique > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email",

Given the concerns of stakeholders in the sector, the General Rapporteur announced that his services will proceed with a preliminary examination of the information collected to determine whether it is necessary to initiate one (or more) investigation(s).    A wide-ranging sector-specific preliminary investigation Autorité de la concurrence Autorité Autorité Autorité Autorité see the press release of 14 December 2010 Autorité INTERNET ADVERTISING: LEADING FORM OF ADVERTISING IN FRANCE Internet advertising in France has become the leading form of advertising (ahead of television). Internet advertising investments were estimated at 3.5 to 4.2 billion euros in 2016; in Europe, France ranks 3rd behind the United Kingdom and Germany. Growth in the sector is strong (12% in France in 2017), supported by the widespread use of programmatic technologies (which allow automation of campaign preparation and deployment), development of video advertising, and the extensive use of social networks, search engines, and video-sharing platforms. One explanation for the success of online advertising, especially compared to television advertising, is that it can be targeted based on collected data. A vast range of data are collected as users navigate the Internet: customer data (interest areas, age, gender, language), contact information (email address, telephone number), usage data (pages consulted, time spent at a site, etc.), purchasing data (products purchased, number of orders), geolocalisation data, interest areas, geographic data, sociodemographic data, etc. It is currently crucial for companies to access this data since this information makes it possible to set up targeted ads and address an identified population. This major upheaval in the advertising sector has led to the development of an entire ecosystem. A SECTOR THAT FUNCTIONS IN A COMPLEX WAY AND IS DOMINATED BY GLOBAL STAKEHOLDERS A sector characterised by the presence of numerous stakeholders… Over the past several years, this development has led to new business areas, new stakeholders, such as Criteo (specialised in retargeting ) and new technologies. There are now services for advertisers, such as trading desks and platforms specialised in programmatic purchasing and the optimisation of campaigns, also called demand side platforms (DSP), which optimise and automate the purchase of advertising space. For publishers, supply side platforms (SSP), which optimise and automate the sale of advertising space, have developed; one example is ad networks that are similar to advertising departments and sell advertising space to small independent sites. The study conducted by the Autorité made it possible to exhaustively describe and analyse the function of this new market, a characteristic of which is the complexity of its processes. The market has many stakeholders, both in terms of publishers and intermediation service providers, whose processes are based on technological services that are not only advanced and innovative, but also highly “sequenced”, which can give an impression of opacity. > For further details on the sector's function, see page 16 and following of the opinion. While very few stakeholders have entered the online advertising market and been able to capture part of its value, the sector's competitive equilibrium is fragile, since stakeholders are confronted with competition from global stakeholders, present at several levels of the value chain (publishing, intermediation), with Google and Facebook leading the pack. …With two major operators: Google and Facebook Facebook and Google, the two leaders of the online advertising sector, mainly provide free services to Internet users and generate most of their revenue from the sale of advertising services to publishers and advertisers. The success of their advertising services is based on their processing of the colossal volume of information they have gathered through the popularity of their sites. Both globally and within France, most of the revenue in this sector is generated by these two operators. The Autorité has identified several significant competitive advantages that Google and Facebook have:  > Strong popularity among Internet users The development of strong positions by Google and Facebook is mainly based on their operation of sites and services popular among Internet users such as Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, Instagram, WhatsApp, and for Facebook, its social network. > Vertical integration and presence in both publishing and advertising intermediation As with other stakeholders, Google and Facebook are involved in both of these activities, but with a number of visitors and with audiences that are unsurpassed on their own sites and applications, the inventories of which are only accessible through their own advertising tools. These same tools can be used for campaigns on third-party sites, and Google, in particular, has developed an unparalleled presence in all of the intermediation activities, by supplying intermediation services, to both advertisers and publishers- services that are sometimes indispensable. > Very powerful targeting capabilities By collecting data not only from their services but also from third-party sites and applications that use their advertising services, Google and Facebook have unrivalled volumes of data, due to the number of users of their services but also the type of data collected: sociodemographic and behavioural.  Given the volume and variety of data but also the size of the advertising inventories on offer, Google and Facebook can provide advertisers with the possibility of reaching broad audience segments (due to the number of users of the services) that are accurately defined (due to usable data and the numerous targeting options).  > Google's specific advertising advantage related to searches Google's range of advertising services is the most extensive on the market. More specifically, Google is one of the rare companies to offer Display and Search advertising services, where it has occupied a very strong position for nearly twenty years. As a result, it has developed several links between Display and Search services, for example by offering a unique interface from which advertisers and their agencies can manage Search campaigns and Display campaigns, and by offering data analysis services based on the two activities. PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AUTORITÉ DE LA CONCURRENCE  As part of the investigation leading to the opinion, many stakeholders described a set of situations and practices involving different advertising sector stakeholders that in some cases, should these situations and practices be determined to exist, could have effects on competition. Among the technical intermediaries, many stakeholders do not have proprietary sites where they can directly sell advertising space. Their position is fragile on many levels. They cannot offer advertisers access to inventories that are as extensive as those offered by Google and they remain in an uncertain situation with regard to their ability to collect data on third-party sites and applications in order to offer customised advertising. Internet users are more and more doubtful about the use of their data and they increasingly use technological solutions offered by software publishers and device manufacturers (especially Apple) that limit data collection and ad display, which has an immediate effect on the revenue and profitability of publishers and certain intermediaries whose activities are based on data use. Furthermore, several stakeholders consider that their situation is weakened by the individual and collective practices of certain stakeholders.   > Strategies involving bundling or tied sales, low prices, and exclusivities Certain stakeholders have identified practices which they consider bundling or tied sales, low prices, and exclusivities: the association of several intermediation services, association of intermediation services and services supplying targeting data, and association between an intermediation service and exclusive access to a site's inventory.  > For further details, see sections 248 to 249 of the opinion > Leveraging effects Other stakeholders point to the leveraging of key positions in certain service markets to enable development on other markets. The behaviours in question concern the media audit and media agency sectors, but also the supply of advertising services and of services for the use of advertiser data. > For further details, see section 250 of the opinion >  Practices involving discriminatory treatment Certain publishers and intermediaries are of the opinion that they are subjected to different treatment by stakeholders they consider dominant in the advertising intermediation sector. These behaviours involve the possibility of monetising certain types of content and the access conditions of DSPs for market positions and certain inventories. > For further details, see section 251 of the opinion  > Impediments to interoperability Several stakeholders also noted the development of impediments to interoperability in the advertising intermediation sector, which could affect the interconnection conditions of certain intermediaries with others in the context of real-time auctions and the deployment of campaigns of their advertiser customers. > For further details, see section 252 of the opinion >  Restrictions on the possibilities of collecting and accessing certain data Lastly, some stakeholders highlighted restrictions concerning the possibility of collecting and accessing certain data. Certain large stakeholders apparently refuse to: integrate tracking information from campaigns for certain advertising formats, supply data on qualification by audience impression, or supply research statistics for advertiser brands. Certain publishers consider that they are also subject to limitations regarding access to data generated by their services and distributed on other platforms. > For further details, see section 254 of the opinion  While it is not legally possible for the Autorité to examine these questions in the context of an opinion, the General Rapporteur announced that his services will proceed with a preliminary examination of the information collected to determine whether it is necessary to initiate one (or more) investigation(s). Only an inter partes examination will make it possible to establish whether these practices exist and whether they are in breach of competition law. Display advertising comprises tiles, banners, and skins, which, in the same manner as traditional advertising billboards within public spaces in cities, are integrated in the content of a publisher's website to be seen by Internet users.

A form of behavioural targeting that consists in addressing an advertising message to profiles that have shown an interest in buying a product, for example by adding items to their basket without completing the purchase when visiting the website of an advertiser.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Located in the intertropical zone, the French overseas collectivities are lands that are especially conducive for the development of termites. In order to combat this plague, the legal and regulatory framework imposes strict protection measures for buildings. In order to do so, buyers and owners can use various preventive and curative extermination methods, such as bait traps soaked with an active substance or biocide. The Dow Agrosciences group currently produces, under the « Sentri Tech » brand, the only biocide-based bait trap whose efficiency is certified overseas. Its traps are almost entirely imported in the concerned territories by a unique importer/wholesaler, which distributes them to dispensers and companies specialized in the anti-termite services. Bans of unjustified exclusive import rights agreements in the French overseas départments The law of 20 November 2012 relating to economic regulation overseas, known as the “Lurel” law, forbade, as of 22 March 2013, agreements containing exclusive import rights in the overseas collectivities.  At the end of its investigation carried following an investigation from the DGCCRF, the Autorité noted that the elements of the case show that in this case , Dow Agrosciences maintained exclusive import clauses in the contracts relating to the marketing of its bait traps for several years and after the entry into force of the “Lurel” law. According to these agreements, Emeraude was the only importer/wholesaler of « Sentri TechTM » products in Réunion, while CTC was the only importer/wholesaler in the French Antilles and French Guiana.  Additionally, the Autorité assessed that Emeraude, which was the only importer/wholesaler of bait traps refused, in a discriminatory manner, to provide these products to the Stop Insectes undertaking which had the required certification in the anti-termite control. This behavior constituted an abuse of dominant position. The sanctions imposed In light of the circumstances of the case, the Autorité pronounced the following sanctions: The Autorité considered that these moderate sanctions, which took into account the size of concerned overseas undertakings, were proportionate as soon as a dissuasive and remedial effect was reached via injunctions. Thus, the Autorité enjoined the Dow Agrosciences group to delete from its contracts for the next two years, any disposition establishing an import exclusivity and to inform in the next two months, by letter, all of the companies using the « Sentri Tech » products of the deletion of the exclusive import clause.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité has found that, despite recent legal decisions, the scope of services covered by the legal monopoly of surveyors remains vague. The Autorité recommends to the legislator to resolve this uncertainty and  to re-examine the merits of services that fall within the legal monopoly of building surveyors.   Background       Today, the Autorité de la concurrence issues an opinion at the request of the Chambre Syndicale Nationale des Géomètres-Topographes (CSNGT) on matters of competition concerning the respective activities of building surveyors and land surveyors, particularly with regard to the definition of the scope of the monopoly granted to the former in application of the Law of 7 May 1946.       The Autorité considers that the definition of this monopoly by the combination of two criteria – one material: the preparation of drawings and topographical documents; the other finalist: real estate boundaries – is the source of great confusion and prevents the harmonious exercise of business activities in this competitive sector.        The uncertainty that surrounds the current definition, as well as the variations of its interpretation over time, have produced legal insecurity that harms the sector's economic efficiency. The Autorité thus recommends to the legislator to re-examine the scope of services that fall under the legal monopoly of building surveyors.        The issues examined in the opinion The complainant requested the opinion of the Autorité on four subjects. For two of them, the conditions for georeferencing certification and the conditions of access to public contracts, the Autorité has not identified competitive concerns that would require modification of current regulations. An educational effort may nevertheless prove useful on a case-by-case basis. The two other subjects, which are essentially the focus of the Autorité's recommendations, concern the extent of the monopoly that benefits the building surveyors. The legal monopoly of building surveyors The core business of surveyors consists in ascertaining the configurations of sites and mapping them on 2D and 3D media. The profession is made up of land surveyors, a non-regulated profession represented by CSNGT, and building surveyors, a profession regulated by the Law of 7 May 1946, which grants it a monopoly for studies and topographical work determining real estate boundaries. Clarifying the scope of the monopoly of building surveyors  The complainant considers that by including land surveying documents that are likely to “have the effect of setting new real estate boundaries and creating real rights that would be attached to them” in the monopoly of building surveyors, the French Supreme Court ( Cour de cassation ) and tax authority have extended the legal monopoly of building surveyors without justification. The Autorité has taken note of the recent rulings of the French Supreme Court and the French Supreme Adminitrative Court ( Conseil d'État ), which have clarified the categories of land surveying documents included in the monopoly of building surveyors by specifying the conditions in which preparation of a land surveying document may fall within the scope of the legal monopoly of building surveyors. Nevertheless, the numerous referrals of complaints or consultations to the Conseil , and then to the Autorité de la concurrence on the subject, as well as the long history of administrative and judicial decisions testify to the recurring difficulties involving interpretation of the legal definition of the monopoly of building surveyors.   Proposal 1 : Given the need to assure economic stakeholders a level of legal security that is compatible with a serene exercise of their competitive activities, the Autorité thus recommends to the legislator to redefine precisely the legal monopoly of building surveyors. Proposal 2: Taking into account the changes that have occurred in this sector since the end of the Second World War, the Autorité suggests that on this occasion the technical, legal and economic justifications that were the basis for granting services exclusively to building surveyors be re-examined.        By excluding land surveyors, even when certified by the tax authorities for cadastral work on certain land surveying documents, the current regulation corresponds, in the estimation of the Autorité , to a reduction in the supply of services by at least 5%, which is far from negligible in terms of the buying power of consumers who use the services of a surveyor        Excluding the drawings and sketches appended to the descriptive schedules for co-ownership partition from the monopoly of building surveyors The complainant alleges that building surveyors are attempting to extend the scope of their monopoly to drawings that are appended to the descriptive schedules for co-ownership partition in an unjustified manner.  The descriptive schedules for co-ownership partition are the documents that designate, in co-ownerships, the parts of the building and land. The descriptive schedules may include a drawing. The Autorité notes that, given the lack the law and regulations and in the absence of any specific legal information on this point, no exclusive right appears to have been granted to building surveyors concerning preparing drawings or sketches appended to descriptive schedules for co-ownership partition. Reserving these drawings exclusively for building surveyors would be tantamount to granting them an unjustified guaranteed income. With more than ten million co-ownerships in France, this would be the same, on average, as giving each surveyor a monopoly on the drawings of more than 5,000 co-ownerships.  Proposal 3: Autorité The purpose of the Autorité's recommendations is to make the law clearer for professionals Ultimately, the subjects covered in this opinion result directly from a problem of interpreting the legal monopoly of building surveyors. In addition to its negative effects on the economy, this uncertainty has significant consequences for the professionals concerned, as the illegal exercise of the profession of building surveyor is subject to criminal prosecution. The legislative clarification recommended by the Autorité would respond to a certain number of basic issues for surveyors as well as public officials: improving the accessibility and intelligibility of the law, limiting litigation, and strengthening the legal security and economic efficiency of the survey sector.  The Autorité notes that in submitting an amendment to the Senate in 2015 as part of the examination of the draft Law for growth, activity, and equal economic opportunities, the government had already sought to “ clarify the definition of activities that could also be performed by land surveyors to create greater competition for these business activities which, legally, do not fall under the exclusive monopoly of the building surveyors ” . Despite two favourable opinions from the Government and the Senate commission, this amendment was finally not adopted, with the parliamentary debate stressing the need first for an exchange with all of the stakeholders concerned. It is precisely this wide consultation that this opinion seeks to encourage, with the Autorité ready, at the request of the legislator, to participate in the effort to redefine this legal monopoly.  A land surveying document is used to identify a parcel by giving it a cadastral reference and to list the contents and surface area of built-up and non-built-up properties. https://www.senat.fr/amendements/2014-2015/371/Amdt_1502.html > See the full Opinion 18-A-02 of 28 February 2018 relating to the surveyor profession  > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 54 01 20 / Email",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following a referral by the government, the Autorité de la Concurrence has issued an opinion that clarifies the conditions for application of competition law in the agricultural sector Background During the French National Food Conference ( États généraux de l'alimentation ), producers, producer organisations and inter-branch organisations from the agricultural sector expressed the need to provide legal certainty for their activities in respect of competition law.  This need for legal certainty is particularly crucial in that the agricultural sector is confronted with specific characteristics (natural constraints, market imbalances, CAP). At the close of the Conference, the French Minister of Economy and Finance submitted a request to the Autorité de la concurrence for an opinion on possible courses of action open to stakeholders in the agricultural sector to allow them to structure the various sub-sectors and balance supply and demand as efficiently as possible.  This referral takes place against a specific backdrop, marked by the recent ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 14 November 2017 handed down in the case known as the Endive case, as well as by the changes to the European legislative framework through the adoption of the “Omnibus” Regulation on 13 December 2017.  1. “ HORIZONTAL” PRACTICES (BETWEEN PRODUCERS)        Which actions can producers take within producer organisations (PO) and associations of producer organisations (APO)? 2. “ VERTICAL” AGREEMENTS (BETWEEN SECTORAL PLAYERS AT INTER-BRANCH LEVEL)       Which actions can be taken by inter-branch organisations (IBO)? 3. “ TRIPARTITE” APPROACHES       How does competition law apply to tripartite approaches bringing together producers, intermediaries and distributors? 4. QUALITY FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS        How does competition law apply to quality food supply chains?         The opinion issued will, in particular, enable the French Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) to draft guidelines on the application of competition law to the sector. 1. THE “ENDIVE” RULING OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE “OMNIBUS” REGULATION HAVE RESPECTIVELY SPECIFIED AND EXPANDED THE POSSIBILITIES OF HORIZONTAL PRACTICES BETWEEN PRODUCERS WITHIN POS AND APOS  POs and APOs are structures set up at the initiative of producers wishing to come together to pool their resources in order to rebalance commercial relations with the upstream and downstream economic players in their sector. There are currently 650 POs, primarily in the dairy, fruit and vegetable, livestock and meat sectors.  The European legislator has, for a long time, advocated the grouping together of producers into POs in order to remedy imbalances in agricultural markets stemming from a fragmented supply structure and concentrated demand. In this respect, according to the publicly available figures, there were around 472,000 agricultural holdings in France in 2016, along with 17,600 agri-food undertakings and 4 major purchasing offices. The “Endive” ruling of the Court of Justice has clarified the legal framework applicable to PO and APO practices. The practices used by POs and APOs and formally recognised by Member States (exchanges of strategic information, collective setting of minimum sales prices, agreements on volumes, etc.) may be exempt from the provisions of Article 101, paragraph 1 of the TFEU if they are absolutely necessary in order to achieve the objectives of POs and APOs in compliance with the CMO Regulation. However, the practices used among POs and APOs are not covered by this exemption from competition law and may thus be prohibited under cartel law. The “Omnibus” Regulation introduced a new exemption from cartel law for official POs and APOs, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, including concentrating supply and placing on the market the production of their members with or without transfer of ownership. Pursuing activities covered by the exemption must not, however, lead to the exclusion of competitors or jeopardise the objectives of the CAP, which would lead to the Autorité or the European Commission to suspend or ban such practices in the future. If they are in doubt as to the compatibility of their practices with competition law, POs and APOs may refer the matter to the European Commission for an opinion. These recent developments should lead to an increase in the concentration of supply through the creation of new POs and APOs, the latter still being fairly limited in number.  > For more details, see pages 17 to 38 2. AS PART OF THEIR SECTORAL STRUCTURING MISSION, IBOS CAN DISSEMINATE INDICATORS AND INDICES, AS WELL AS STANDARD VALUE-SHARING CLAUSES, SUCH AS THOSE ESTABLISHED IN THE OMNIBUS REGULATION, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS. Interbrand-organizations (IBOs), including representatives of the production sector and at least one partner from the supply chain (processors or distributors) are created in response to common problems and act in the general interests of all of their members. For historical reasons, they are a very active form of organisation in the structuring of agricultural and food sectors in France. As underlined by the French Minister in the referral, the French National Food Conference highlighted a strong demand for transparency in the markets and the need to take better account of production costs when determining the purchase prices of agricultural products. Publication by IBOs of relevant indicators and indices has developed as one of the principal tools used. In this respect, the Autorité recalls that IBOs are allowed to publish anonymous and sufficiently aggregated historic statistical data.  Thus, IBOs may, for example, provide their members with general economic information, produce standard contracts, launch quality or trading-up initiatives or promote products among consumers. Inter-branch organisations may also make use of the option explicitly granted to them in the Omnibus Regulation to establish standard value-sharing clauses between farmers and their initial buyers.  The exemptions from competition rules granted to them under the CMO Regulation differ from those granted to POs and APOs. They cannot, for example, establish volume control actions. The CMO Regulation explicitly bans IBOs from fixing prices and quotas. Moreover, when they develop their own indicators, which can entail exchanges of strategic information within the IBO, they must ensure compliance with competition rules, for example in respect of the conditions for collecting information. Lastly, the indicators and value-sharing clauses must not be of a prescriptive nature or become compulsory, including within the framework of an extension of an inter-branch agreement, and must not be akin to price recommendations that could lead to a collective agreement on the price levels adopted by operators.  If they have any doubts about the indicators or standard clauses they are developing, IBOs can notify them to the European Commission in order to ensure that they comply with competition law.  > For more details, see pages 39 to 55 3 . TRIPARTITE APPROACHES GUARANTEE EFFICIENCY GAINS FOR THE PARTIES SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS In the agricultural sector, the fluctuation of supply and demand in the markets has prompted some players to use contractualisation in the form of tripartite approaches between producers, processors and distributors. These actions often entail a series of bipartite contracts, between producers and processors and between processors and distributors, for a specific volume of production and specific purchase prices, subject to compliance with a set of product quality criteria. These tripartite agreements are likely to yield large efficiency gains for the different parties: better remuneration and guarantee of outlets for the producer, guarantee for the processor of monetizing part of its infrastructure, guarantee for the distributor of a supply that meets its requirements in terms of quality, transparency and better quality for the consumer.  The parties to a tripartite agreement must, however, be careful when they own a market share in excess of the 30% threshold established by the Regulation on Vertical Restraints, especially if the contract is based on an exclusive relationship between a producer or a group of producers and its buyer. > For more details, see pages 56 to 60 4. MAKING USE OF EXEMPTIONS GRANTED BY AGRICULTURAL LEGISLATION ALLOWS PRODUCERS TO SECURE THE TRADING UP OF THEIR PRODUCTS.  In respect of trading up practices, the Autorité recommends that stakeholders in the agricultural sector make use of the exemptions specific to the agricultural sector. In this respect, the CMO Regulation allows Member States, at the request of producers, their associations, or IBOs, to adopt legally binding supply control measures for cheeses and ham covered by a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) or a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), as well as in the wine-producing sector.  These specific exemptions to competition rules based on quality considerations relate exclusively to volume management and may not relate to prices. The parties heard by the Autorité appreciate the effectiveness of such rules for the competitiveness of their sectors. In this respect, in the interests of clarifying the rules, the Autorité recommends extending the existing supply control measures in these sectors covered by PDOs and PGIs to other products covered by such designations.  > For more details, see pages 61 to 68  > See full text of Opinion18-A-05 of 3 May 2018 regarding the agricultural sector   > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email > For more information about opinions, see our video  ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines the Syndicat général des vignerons réunis des Côtes du Rhône (the professional syndicate of Côte du Rhône winemakers) for an anticompetitive agreement Based on a report submitted by the French Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), the Autorité de la concurrence has today issued its decision to issue a fine of 20 000 € to the Syndicat général des vignerons réunis des Côtes du Rhône (SGVRCR) for having established and disseminated pricing instructions to its members between 2010 and 2017. A “minimum price” set by the professional syndicate As of 2010, the professional syndicate established and disseminated annual price lists in the aim of pushing up bulk wine prices . Once the target “minimum price” had been reached (2014), the syndicate disseminated price recommendations in order to stabilise the prices. Broad dissemination of price instructions to winemakers The price instructions were relayed in “Le Vigneron”, which is a magazine that is published and distributed by the syndicate to producers, via newsletters sent to all subscribers and at “sector” meetings. These instructions were accompanied by a discourse designed to encourage winemakers to make use of these price lists for the purpose of their sales negotiations. The price recommendations related to all bulk wines covered by the Côtes du Rhône registered designation of origin (AOC), broken down by colour (white, rosé, red) and, for red wines, by product range (“bottom shelf”, “middle shelf”, or “top shelf”). The professional syndicate established a price arrangement In view of its nature and functions, a professional syndicate is not intended to be recognized as a producer organization (PO) or an association of producer organisations (APO), which are structures that are respectively made up at the initiative of producers or producer organisations and which pursue mostly economic goals.  Within the legal framework renewed by, amongst others, the regulation of 13 December 2017 known as “Omnibus regulation”, the recent Autorité opinion 18-A-4 of 3 May 2018 regarding the agricultural sector reviewed the possibilities of common action available to official POs and APOs. The latter can thus, subject to certain conditions –e.g. concentrating supply and placing on the market the production of their members - derogate from cartel law by negotiating common contractual conditions or even a common price for the production of its members.  Outside this strictly defined legal framework, it is not possible to derogate from cartel law to negotiate a common price.  Thus, if official interbrand-organizations can disseminate indicators, it is normally only if the latter are not similar to pricing instructions.  Similarly, the role of a syndicate is to help its members to manage their companies. Although it may disseminate information designed to help its members manage their companies, it may not exert any direct influence on the prices charged by its members, which must determine such prices individually based on their own costs. By establishing and disseminating pricing instructions to its members for each wine year between 2010 and 2017, the syndicate established a price-fixing agreement.  Consequently, regarding the circumstances of the case, the Autorité has imposed a fine of 20 000 Euro against Syndicat général des vignerons réunis des Côtes du Rhône. The professional syndicate must also notify its members of the decision of the Autorité via a newsletter using the same arrangements as those used to disseminate the pricing instructions which were fined.  > See the full text of decision 18-D-06 of 23 May 2018 regarding practices used in the sector involved in the marketing of bulk wines with the Côtes du Rhône registered designation of origin (AOC) > Press contact: Chloé Duretête - +33 (0)1 55 04 01 20 / Email  ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines wholesale distributors of veterinary medicinal products and their professional association nearly 16 million euros for anticompetitive practices The Autorité de la concurrence , which began proceedings ex officio on the basis of an investigative report by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), fines Alcyon France and Alcyon, Coveto, Centravet, Hippocampe Caen, Agripharm and Chrysalide, Coveto Limoges, Véto Santé, Elvetis and Neftys Pharma and the Federation for the distribution of veterinary medicinal products ( Fédération de la Distribution du Médicament Vétérinaire, FDMV) for taking part in several cartels in the distribution of veterinary medicinal products in breach of Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the first paragraph of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The companies in question did not contest the facts and benefited from a reduction in the fine as part of a settlement procedure. The veterinary medicinal products market France is one of the main livestock producing countries in the European Union and has the largest pet population in Europe. It is the leading market in Europe for veterinary medicinal products.  The veterinary medicinal product sector in France is organised into three distinct levels (see chart below):   - upstream, the manufacture of veterinary medicinal products by laboratories;  - at an initial intermediate stage, the wholesale distribution of veterinary medicinal products by distributors, consignment services providers or veterinary groups; - at a second intermediate stage, the retail sale of these medicinal products by eligible parties - 80% of whom are veterinarians - to end users (breeders and animal owners).    The top three companies in the sector (constituting 70% of veterinary medicinal product sales) had concluded “non-aggression” pacts amongst themselves to freeze out competition and divide up the customers Thus, the first two practices for which fines were imposed consisted in the conclusion of “non-aggression pacts” between Alcyon (market leader) and Coveto (third largest market share), on the one hand, and Centravet (second largest market share) and Coveto, on the other.  By not soliciting their respective customers for nearly three years (from January 2007 to the end of 2009) for the first agreement and two months for the second (from 21 October 2009 to 2 December 2009), these companies limited their commercial independence and restricted competition on the markets concerned. Such market sharing agreements are, by their very nature, serious breaches of competition law. Furthermore, all distributors and their professional association, FDMV, agreed to profit from the health emergency caused by the rapid spread of bluetongue between 2007 and 2010. In 2007 and 2008, France was confronted with a bluetongue epidemic. In parallel with the application of health measures, three compulsory vaccination campaigns were ordered in France from spring 2008 to autumn 2010 by the Director General for Food (DGAL) at the French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Taking advantage of the health crisis, all wholesale distributors and the FDMV: >> agreed on the level of costs they would respectively present to the government in order to maximise the amount of compensation they would receive for the logistical services provided to ensure the distribution of vaccines during the three vaccination campaigns,  In addition to its gravity, this strategy in particular enabled the companies in question to make substantial illegal profits. Indeed, according to the distributors' own declarations, the level of reimbursement of logistics costs of 4 euro cents obtained from the government was much higher than the actual costs incurred for the service, which was between 1 and 2.5 euro cents. Some messages exchanged between distributors during the bluetongue epidemic show that they were fully aware of the difference between the price claimed and the cost incurred, as seen in the following example: I'm at Coveto today if you want to contact me. For fun, did you happen to multiply 49 million and €0.04 and €0.01 to see if it covered our costs (and the container of champagne LOL!)? I'm also asking if we should contact the labs for the amendment or if they should contact us.  >>jointly set prices charged to veterinarians during the second and third compulsory vaccination campaigns .  Moreover, several documents in the files testify to the full knowledge that these distributors had of the illicit nature of their behaviour, as this excerpt from a report seized during dawn raids shows: Centravet – Coveto and Acyon at the same level => risk DGCCRF Serious contraventions By their very nature, these various cartel practices constitute especially grave breaches of competition law. In determining the amount of the penalties, the Autorité took into account the particular seriousness of the breach committed with the backing of FDMV during the bluetongue health crisis. Indeed, it appears that wholesale distributors profited from the health emergency linked to the rapid spread of the disease and the absence of a call for tenders to knowingly mislead the public purchaser as to the real logistical costs of delivering the vaccines borne by each of them and thus compromise the proper use of public funds. The Autorité finds that the FDMV played a pivotal role in the development and organisation of the breach of law in the context of the health crisis stemming from the spread of bluetongue. Indeed, during the first vaccination campaign, it participated in the development and distribution to wholesale distributors of the calculation method used to overestimate their costs in order to obtain a higher amount of compensation from the government. During the following two campaigns, the FDMV used all its influence to convince distributors not to concede to a reduction in the amount of compensation for costs claimed from the government compared to that obtained during the first campaign.  The entities concerned have all requested to benefit from the settlement procedure. Consequently, the Autorité has handed down the following fines:  - €10,000,000 jointly and severally for Alcyon France and Alcyon;  - €1,400,000 euros for Centravet;  - €4,300,000 euros for Coveto;  - €180,000 euros for Hippocampe Caen;  - €18,000 euros jointly and severally for Agripharm Santé Animale and Chrysalide;  - €55,000 euros jointly and severally for Coveto Limoges and Coveto;  - €1,400 euros jointly and severally for Véto Santé, Elvetis and Neftys Pharma;  - €3,000 euros for the Fédération de la Distribution du Médicament Vétérinaire .  > See the full text of Decision 18-D-15 of 26 July 2018 regarding practices implemented in the distribution of veterinary medicinal products sector > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email > This decision was submitted before the cour d'appel de Paris (pending case)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence fines Fnac Darty Group €20 million for failing to divest itself of three stores, which was the pre-condition for clearance of the transaction.  The Autorité also orders Fnac Darty to divest itself of two stores in lieu of those that it failed to sell. The Autorité had cleared, in 2016, the transaction on condition that Fnac Darty divest six stores in Paris and the Parisian region In 2016, when it examined Fnac's acquisition of Darty, the Autorité de la concurrence noted that the transaction was likely to harm competition in the retail markets for brown (televisions, hi-fi and audio equipment) and grey products (personal computers, screens, peripheral devices, telephones) due to the absence of competitive pressure in several catchment areas, especially in Paris . In order to remedy the anti-competitive effects of the transaction, Fnac had committed to divesting itself, by 1 August 2017, of six stores located in Paris and the Parisian region: Darty Wagram, Darty Italie 2, Fnac Beaugrenelle, Darty Belleville, Darty Saint-Ouen and Darty Vélizy. Three of the six stores were not sold to an approved buyer before the deadline: Fnac Beaugrenelle, Darty Belleville and Darty Saint-Ouen The Autorité de la concurrence noted that Fnac Darty had failed to meet its divestiture commitments.  It failed to submit a divestiture contract or put forward a buyer for the Fnac Beaugrenelle store and the buyer presented for the Darty Belleville and Darty Saint-Ouen stores was not approved by the Autorité , as it did not meet all the requisite characteristics to compete effectively with the new entity in the brown and grey goods markets. The failure by Fnac Darty to meet half of its commitments has distorted competition and limited consumer choice  Isabelle de Silva, President of the Autorité de la concurrence , stated: “ When a company makes commitments to the Autorité de la concurrence in order to receive clearance to acquire another company, it must understand that it has to deliver on its commitment. All commitments must be observed, save for exceptional circumstances. By failing to divest itself of three of the six stores it had committed to sell within the prescribed deadline, Fnac Darty has committed a serious breach of its obligations which prevented consumers from quickly benefiting from a new source of electronic products in Paris.” It is important that the company comply with all of its commitments. The commitments are a package, which covers all of the competition problems identified. By failing to comply with half of the commitments, Fnac Darty has undermined the overall balance sought by the decision and hindered the restoration of competition in several catchment areas, thereby depriving consumers of alternatives.  In order to determine the amount of the fine imposed, the Autorité took into account all of the circumstances of the case and noted the efforts made by Fnac Darty at the beginning of the commitment period to divest the three first stores. However, it considered that, confronted with difficulties in finding a buyer for the three other stores, it was Fnac Darty's responsibility to take the appropriate measures to fulfill its commitments, for instance by asking the Autorité to substitute other stores for those it wasn't able to sell. In view of these elements, the Autorité hands out a fine of €20 million to Fnac Darty and orders it to divest itself of the Darty Montmartre and Darty Passy stores in lieu of those that were not sold . The Autorité also orders Fnac Darty to sell the Darty Montmartre and Darty Passy stores to a competitor, which will have to be approved by the Autorité de la concurrence , in lieu of the divestiture commitments that were not carried out.  These injunctions will serve to restore the competitive structure of the brown and grey product retail markets in the relevant catchment areas of Paris. This is the first time that the Autorité de la concurrence has fined a company for non-compliance with structural commitments which conditioned a clearance of a transaction (consisting of divesting assets by a given deadline). As a reminder, the Autorité had nonetheless imposed fines on behaviour that removed the substance from commitments that had been made . 1 See the press release of 18 July 2016 2 Bigard/Socopa ( decision 12-D-15 ) and Numericable/SFR ( 16-D-07 /conditions of divestiture of Outremer télécom and 17-D-04 /equipping buildings with fibre optic) > See the full text of the decision 18-D-16 > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email  > This decision was submitted before the Conseil d'Etat (pending case)",

The Autorité has imposed a fine for excessive and abusive price increases  Following a report by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), the Autorité de la concurrence has imposed a fine of 199 000 euros on Sanicorse for abuse of dominant position between 2011 and 2015. The company benefited from its monopoly and tried to deter new entrants from entering the market by increasing abruptly, durably and significantly its waste disposal rates for infectious medical waste generated by healthcare establishments in Corsica. Sanicorse, the only infectious medical waste treatment company in Corsica Healthcare establishments are obliged under the public health code to treat and dispose of infectious medical waste under precise conditions and within specified deadlines. To do this, they can make use of specialist service providers, such as Sanicorse, which is, in Corsica, the only company active in the waste disposal sector. Unjustified price increases imposed on healthcare establishments for a period of over four years From February 2011 onwards, Sanicorse imposed abrupt, lasting and significant price increases on the island's healthcare establishments. The average price imposed by Sanicorse increased by around 88% between 2010 and 2012. This general increase was also reflected in significant individual increases:   For example: - Centre hospitalier de Castelluccio: + 194 % in 2011.  - Centre hospitalier de Sartène: +19% in 2011, +87% in 2012 (i.e., +123% in total).  - Polyclinique du Sud de la Corse: +135 % in 2012.  For more details, see paragraph 65 and following of the decision These price increases were introduced at the same time that Sanicorse was threatening to terminate contracts or was opting not to bid for tenders in the sector (including bloc tenders for all healthcare establishments). These increases continued through to 2015 and were not justified by any of the explanations put forward by Sanicorse, particularly those explanations based on increases to its costs and its investments. On the contrary, the Autorité noted that the significant price increase strategy implemented by Sanicorse resulted from a desire to deter the healthcare institutions from developing alternative solutions for the disposal of infectious medical waste. Faced with no other alternative, the healthcare establishments, which had been “taken hostage” to echo the term used by the Polyclinique du Sud de la Corse, were in the end forced to conclude individual contracts at the prices set by Sanicorse. These practices had an adverse impact on the finances of healthcare establishments in Corsica  These unfair practices generated an unjustified additional cost for healthcare establishments, which had no other choice than to agree to the conditions imposed by Sanicorse. This additional cost has been particularly harmful in that certain Corsican hospitals are experiencing significant financial difficulties - as noted by the Court of Auditors - and these sums could have been used to improve the quality of public and private healthcare services. Consequently, the Autorité de la concurrence has fined Sanicorse 199 000€.  A sanction which falls within established decision-making practice of competition authorities as regards unfair and excessive prices. In view of French and European competition law, companies which are in a leading position can be sanctioned when they abuse this position by imposing unfair prices: we then talk of “exploitative abuse” ( abus d'exploitation ).        The Autorité , which had in the past sanctioned pricing practices of a dominant operator in the telecom sector in French overseas territories ( Decision 09-D-24 / Press release of 28 July 2009 ) today fines Sanicorse, as it considers that the company used its position in the market to practice abusive price increases for its captive customers. This increase was implemented abruptly, significantly, durably and the company was unable to offer any objective or relevant justifications to explain this increase. > See Decision 18-D-17 of 20 September 2018 regarding practices implemented in the waste disposal for infectious medical waste sector in Corsica > See our infographics > Press contact: Chloé Duretête +33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email > This decision was submitted before the cour d'appel de Paris (pending case)",

The company AGN Avocats lodged a complaint with the Autorité relating to a set of practices that is alleged to have been adopted by the Limoges Bar Association Council and designed, according to the company, to push it out of the market. Its complaint was also accompanied by a request for interim measures. AGN avocats presents itself as a new economic model for legal firms AGN Avocats has established a network of around fifteen agencies in France based on a standardised model that aims to make the lawyer “more accessible” to their client (ground-floor agency, transparent “shop” window, pictograms displaying the fields of expertise of the lawyer, displaying of a fee schedule, online services, etc.). The practices of the Limoges Bar Association that have been challenged by AGN Avocats AGN avocats challenged two decisions taken by the Limoges Bar Association concerning the opening of a new AGN Avocats agency in Limoges: • Firstly, by rejecting the application for opening a supplementary agency ; • Then, by refusing to register a company belonging to the AGN Avocats chain with the Limoges Bar Association. AGN Avocats also complained about the opinions, which seemed systematically negative, issued by the Rules and Practices Committee of the National Bar Council ( Commission des règles et usages du Conseil national des barreaux ) on its economic model, especially on the issues relating to the display of fields of expertise in the agency's window “shop”. Lastly, it alleged that the Limoges Bar Council had implemented an illegal cartel with the Toulouse Bar Council in an attempt to hamper its development.  The Autorité considers that part of the elements of the case do not fall within its remit After examining the facts of the case, it transpires that the two aforementioned decisions taken by the Bar Council rejecting AGN Avocats' application to open a new agency in Limoges, either as a supplementary agency or as a company belonging to the AGN Avocats chain with the Limoges Bar Association show the exercise, in a measure that is not patently inappropriate, of the prerogatives of its official powers. Consequently, the case falls outside the jurisdiction of the Autorité. Lack of supporting evidence for the rest of the complaint As regards the opinions issued by the Rules and Practices Committee of the National Bar Council, none of the evidence in the case was sufficient to conclude that the opinions were designed to exclude the economic model adopted by AGN Avocats from the legal services sector.  Lastly, although the Toulouse and Limoges Bar Associations may have adopted behaviours that could be considered, to a certain extent, similar, there is no evidence to prove that they may have “colluded” with each other to force AGN out of the market. Consequently, the Autorité has closed the case and declared the complaint inadmissible in respect of some of the contested practices and dismissed the remainder of the complaint as it lacked relevant evidence.

The \"Lurel Act\" has banned any exclusive import agreement since March 2013.  The Overseas Economic Regulations Act of 20 November 2012 known as the “Lurel Act” banned unjustified exclusive importing into overseas territories as from 22 March 2013. The exclusive import agreements which General Import benefited from involved consumer goods After the “Lurel Act” came into effect and until 2015, General Import benefited from exclusive import rights for the Wallis-and-Futuna territory for the purchase of consumer goods.  The suppliers and products concerned were Sun Rice (rice), Heinz (Pacific Corned Beef cans and Golden Circle products : drinks, sodas, fruit juices and canned fruit), Campbell Arnott's (biscuits), Chelsea (sugar) and Anchor (powdered milk). Practices which foreclosed competitors and weighed on household purchasing power  These practices hampered the development of competing wholesaler-importers and lowered competition between wholesalers that retailers were entitled to expect for their supply.  This resulted in an increase in cost for retailers, and thus, for those of basic consumer foodstuffs' prices in Wallis and Futuna, where purchasing power is much lower than in mainland France.  In consequence, the Autorité de la concurrence fined General Import and its parent company ADLP Holding 250 000 euros (30 Million CFP). Further, it required it to inform by mail every supplier impacted by the prohibited exclusive agreements covered by today's decision. 18-D-03 press release of 20 February 2018 17-D-14 press release of 27 July 2017 16-D-15 press release of 6 July 2016 15-D-14 press release of 10 September 2015 > See the full text of Decision 18-D-21 of 8 October 2018 regarding practices implemented in the exclusive distribution of consumer goods in Wallis-and-Futuna > Press contact: Chloé Duretête - +33 0(1) 55 04 01 20 / Email > This decision was submitted before the cour d'appel de Paris (pending case)",

However, the Autorité approved the principle of using selective distribution for this type of product, along with an interdiction against selling them on third party platforms. With this decision, the Autorité issues for the first time a decision on the selective distribution possibilities and the possibilities of restrictions on online sale since the judgment of the CJEU in the Coty case of 6 December 2017 , which clarified the common framework applied to selective distribution on the Internet. This decision aims to specify the applicable framework in France for the different sectors and products, beyond the outdoor power equipment sector.  In view of the nature of the products sold by Stihl, the implementation of a network of authorised distributors is legitimate It is possible for a manufacturer to restrict the sale of its products to a network of specialized dealers for legitimate requirements such as the sale of high-quality or high-technology products. In this case, the Autorité does not call into question the use of selective distribution for products, which, like the ones sold by Stihl (chainsaws, brushcutters, pole-saws, electric pruners), justifiy the setting up of assistance and consultancy services in order to preserve their quality and ensure their proper use. The necessity to verify compliance with these obligations and to preserve its brand image also justifies the ban on online retailing of the products in question on third-party platforms. But the terms of online sales established by Stihl disproportionally limit competition By demanding a hand-delivery of this type of product by the distributor to the buyer and therefore imposing a collection from the dealer, or a delivery to the home of the buyer, Stihl de facto forbade the sales of its products on its distributors' websites. However, this hand-delivery is not required by any national or European regulation concerning the marketing of the products in question. Neither direct contact between the distributor and the buyer nor a demonstration of use are required. Only the handover of a user manual in the buyer's language with a mention of certain specific information concerning hazardous products is mandatory. Diminished competition to the detriment of consumers By imposing this hand-delivery, Stihl removed any interest in online retail for distributors and consumers, who could not benefit from competition between distributors and benefit from more attractive prices (up to 10% cheaper). In view of these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence fined Stihl 7 million euros.

Why are vertical pricing agreements forbidden in competition law? Autorité perfume heating equipment The decision issued today Autorité de la concurrence Liquid fertilisers are used in farming/ plant cultivation  Liquid fertilisers are fertilisers and additives whose function is to provide essential nutrients to plants (vegetables, flowers, fruit) grown above ground, i.e. in a substrate without soil. Hydroponic culture, or off-ground cultivation, which is both productive and water-efficient, tends to develop in France for numerous uses (such as urban agriculture, vertical farming, roof gardens and green spaces in buildings).  The fertilisers are offered for sale through specialised distribution channels, in stores or online, and target well-informed consumers. Manufacturers consulted their wholesale distributors to determine the resale prices of their products E-mails seized during dawn raids show that the four manufacturers concerned (Canna, GHE, Bertels and Biobizz) each agreed with one or two wholesale distributors , CIS (Culture Indoord brand) and Hydro Factory/Hydro Logistique (Indoor Gardens brand), to set the resale prices of their products. The objective was to boost the margins of wholesale distributors. In practice, resale price lists were set between each manufacturer and wholesale distributor. In order to ensure compliance with the price fixing, they implemented measures to monitor and/or police wholesale distributors, and even considering reprisals against those considering to apply prices lower than the fixed prices. These practices contributed to levelling of prices These vertical agreements contributed to harmonised fertiliser prices, thus reducing price competition for the same product within different networks (intra-brand competition) and depriving consumers, to an extent, of the benefit of competitive prices. The impact of these practices was even more harmful because the wholesale distributors concerned were among the largest in the sector. Fines imposed As a result of these actions, the Autorité has imposed fines, the amount of which has been calculated based - among other reasons - on the value of the sales affected by the practices according to the usual calculating methods of the Autorité . In its calculation, it took into account the individual situation of each company and, in particular, the financial difficulties of Hydro Factory/Hydro Logistique, which received a reduction in penalties of more than 99% as a result.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Google will need to clarify promptly the rules of its Google Ads online advertising platform that apply to directory enquiry services in order to make them more precise and intelligible and to ensure their application under non-discriminatory conditions. Background Amadeus, which offers the 118 001 directory enquiry service, has referred Google's practices to the Autorité de la concurrence. It accuses Google of having suspended, as of January 2018, several of its accounts with the advertising service AdWords (which became Google Ads in the summer of 2018), and then having refused most of the ads it wanted to run to promote its services. In addition to its complaint on the merits of the case, it has requested that interim measures be implemented. While Google is free to define its policy on content allowed on Google Ads, in particular to protect consumers, it is important - given its pre-eminent position in the market (90% of researches carried out in France) - that the implementation of these rules be carried out under objective and transparent conditions and that they do not lead to discriminatory treatment among competing companies. In the current state of the investigation, the Autorité considers that Google's practices towards Amadeus are likely to characterise a sudden termination of commercial relations under conditions that are neither objective nor transparent. It also considers that these practices might be considered as constituting an abuse of a dominant position in so far as they are discriminatory. In the current state of the investigation, it appears that Amadeus' accounts were suspended without warning or any clear mention of the alleged breaches, even though in the present case, Google's sales teams were very closely involved in the development of Amadeus' advertising campaigns as part of a special partnership. In addition, competitors of Amadeus appear to have been able to run ads that were identical to those which were refused in the case of Amadeus. In view of the very significant effects of these practices on Amadeus' business, the Autorité de la concurrence has, pending its decision on the merits, issued interim measures in order to obtain from Google in particular: clarification of the Google Ads rules it applies to directory enquiry information services; a review of Amadeus' situation under these new rules with a view to giving it access, as appropriate, to the Google Ads service again if the ads comply with them.  The Google Ads service Advertisements displayed by Google appear in particular above or below the results of the natural referencing of its search engine. They are distinguished from natural results by the mention “Ad” in front of the sponsored link. These ads are displayed when the keywords entered by the user are the same as those attached to an ad by an advertiser. To be able to run paid ads of this type, advertisers must open Google Ads accounts and then participate in keyword auctions. The facts alleged against Google by Amadeus As of January 2018, Google informed Amadeus, which used the Google Ads service to generate calls to 118 001, of the suspension of its accounts because of \"misrepresentation” or because they presented “serious or recurring cases of non-compliance with our advertising rules”. However, in the case in point, these campaigns had been carried out in close cooperation with Google's sales teams in context of a specific partnership developed with Amadeus, proposing in-depth consultancy services in exchange for the advertising investments made. In response to these suspensions, Amadeus created new Google Ads accounts, which in turn were suspended on the grounds of “abusing the ad network”. In mid-March 2018, the accounts were reactivated but most of the ads Amadeus tried to run trough those accounts were rejected, the basis for the rejection being the “sale of free items”.  Considering that Google had suddenly suspended some of its Google Ads accounts under non-transparent, non-objective and discriminatory conditions, Amadeus brought the matter before the Autorité de la concurrence. A sudden break in business relations under conditions that are neither objective nor transparent and potentially discriminatory Google has a pre-eminent position in France since it accounts for 90% of all online searches. In addition, there are high barriers to entering this market given the significant investments that must be made to develop such a powerful algorithm and carry out exhaustive content indexing, as well as the accumulated data available to Google. Finally, because of their large number and lack of alternatives, advertisers do not have the bargaining power that could offset Google's strong position. In this case, Google is responsible for almost all the traffic of the sites run by Amadeus and thus generates most of the calls received by 118 001. Moreover, the level of notoriety of the number does not enable it to maintain its business without the paid  referencing offered by Google, the results of natural referencing being close to zero or nil.  At this stage, the evidence of the file tends to show that the suspension of Amadeus' accounts occurred without warning or clear mention of the alleged breaches. In addition, the account suspensions occurred despite the fact that Google's sales teams had been involved in the development of the advertising campaigns. Finally, the same type of advertisement continued to be allowed for other advertisers, who were able to continue publishing similar ads to those denied to Amadeus. In view of these details, the Autorité considers that Google's practices might characterise a sudden termination of business relations under non-objective, non-transparent and discriminatory conditions. Interim measures taken Google's practices have put Amadeus in a critical situation. It has suffered a massive and very sudden loss of turnover (drop of 90% between 2017 and 2018) and has had negative results since the practices began to the point that it may soon have to leave the market.  In view of the potentially anti-competitive nature of the practices and the serious and immediate damage they cause to Amadeus' interests, the Autorité considered it necessary to obtain, pending the decision on the merits, guarantees regarding the objective, transparent and non-discriminatory application of the Google Ads Rules. Consequently, the Autorité orders Google to: clarify the Google Ads rules applicable to electronic paid information services in order to make them more accurate and intelligible; review the procedure for suspending the accounts of advertisers in the directory enquiry information services sector, providing for a formal warning and sufficient notice to enable advertisers, except in serious situations, to justify, remedy or request explanations for the alleged breach; conduct an individual review of the compliance of the campaigns proposed by Amadeus' unsuspended accounts with the clarified rules and, if this review reveals that these ads are indeed in compliance, authorise Amadeus to run its advertising under non-discriminatory conditions; provide training for its sales staff on the content of clarified Google Ads rules so that they can alert advertisers on cases of non-compliance. The Autorité reiterates that Google is free to determine its content policy, but that it must be sufficiently intelligible to economic stakeholders and be carried out in an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory mannerso that all advertisers in the same sector are treated equally.  The Autorité will ensure the proper implementation of these interim measures and will issue its decision on the merits of the case in the coming months. What are interim measures? This is a provisional decision, pending the decision on the merits, which the Autorité may issue as a matter of urgency when it considers that the practices complained of might infringe competition law and cause serious and immediate damage to competition or to a stakeholder in a sector. Until now, such a request had to be submitted to the Autorité de la concurrence by the parties. From now on, the ECN+ Directive, which has just been published in the OJEU, will allow the Autorité, when the text is transposed, to impose ex officio interim measures even in the absence of a complaint by a company. What is the scope of interim measures and does this mean that there has been infringement? The decision ordering interim measures does not constitute a finding of an infringement of competition law: only the investigation on the merits of the case will make it possible to establish the facts and decide on the offences alleged by the complaint. Nevertheless, interim measures are binding on the company concerned until the decision is taken on the merits of the case. What is the role of interim measures in the Autorité de la concurrence's range of powers? Since its creation in 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence has ruled in 44 decisions on requests for interim measures and, in eight cases, it has granted them. Within the European network of competition authorities, France stands out by the existence of this procedure, which it does not hesitate to use when it considers that the conditions are met. In ordering interim measures, the Autorité may avoid, during the duration of the investigation, that any practice likely to be anti-competitive will cause serious harm to competition or to the company which is the victim of it. Its effect is thus similar to that of an interim injunction issued by the judge pending the decision on the merits of the case. Examples of previous interim measures For example, in 2010, the Autorité intervened in the online advertising sector by ordering Google to implement in an objective, transparent and non-discriminatory manner the content policy of its AdWords service for roadside radars ( Navx decision 10-MC-01 ). Since 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence has issued eight decisions on interim measures in various sectors such as energy and audiovisual. Examples include: - it ordered GDF Suez to grant its competitors access to part of the data from its historical file of regulated retail tariff customers ( decision 14-MC-02 ). - it urgently imposed several measures on Engie to ensure that the price of certain contracts to companies reflect its costs ( 16-MC-01 ). - it suspended the agreement between the National Rugby League and Canal Plus Group granting the latter exclusive broadcasting rights to the Top 14 matches for five seasons ( decision 14-MC-01 ).

        "full_text_press_realease": "In the context of the reform of the audiovisual sector, the Committee on Cultural Affairs and Education of the French National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) referred this matter to the Autorité de la concurrence, which today delivers its opinion. In the face of the digital revolution, the Autorité is announcing its proposals for reforms to ease the constraints on incumbent audiovisual stakeholders to enable them to compete on equal terms with online video platforms (Amazon, Netflix). Last June, the Autorité de la concurrence was asked by the Committee on Cultural Affairs and Education of the French National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) to give its opinion on the upcoming government bill on audiovisual reform. After several months of investigation, hearings and information gathering with stakeholders in the sector, the Autorité de la concurrence is now issuing its opinion and making several recommendations aimed at relaxing the current legislative and regulatory framework in order to take into account the sector's digital revolution and enable the incumbent players to compete effectively with the new video distribution platforms. Among these, the Autorité principally proposes: - to relax the obligations relating to broadcasters' investments in cinematographic and audiovisual works; - to open up television advertising to prohibited sectors (cinema, publishing, mass retail promotional campaigns),  - to allow targeted advertising based on the model of advertising on the Internet. THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION: AN UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE FOR THE AUDIOVISUAL SECTOR Although DTT broadcasting remains very popular today, the majority of consumers now access programmes via the triple play or quadruple play offers of Internet service providers (ISPs) or, without going through ISPs services, through \"Over The Top\" (OTT), i.e. directly on the open Internet, for example via a connected television. With these new forms of broadcasting, made possible by the gradual expansion of broadband and high-speed broadband, new companies have recently entered the market: mainly subscription video-on-demand (VOD) platforms such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. These platforms, which enable new uses and more freedom for consumers, are enjoying very rapid success: Netflix, which entered the market in 2014, now has more than five million subscribers, more than Canal Plus. For consumers, the new platforms make it possible to watch a film, a series, a work of fiction, or a documentary “when you want, where you want and with the device you want.” This shift to nonlinear media, which are free from the programme schedules of linear television channels, offers the liberty of choosing to watch a programme from very rich catalogues available on any terminal: computer, tablet, laptop, connected TV, including large international productions, for a reduced price (€8-13 for Netflix, and without additional cost for Amazon Prime subscribers).  In terms of business model, these new platforms also innovate by integrating content production, publishing and distribution functions, i.e. the entire traditional audiovisual value chain, into the same company.  Netflix and Amazon invest heavily in the production of programmes, particularly “original” programmes that they produce directly, with full exploitation rights in all regions and for a very long time. As a result, their investment capacity is disproportionate to that of suppliers of national channels since their subscriber base is global and not national, and the rights in the catalogue have no termination date.  In addition, unlike linear channels, digital platforms benefit from access to their users' data, enabling them to constantly improve their offers as well as their recommendation algorithms. INCUMBENT OPERATORS DESTABILISED BY THE EMERGENCE OF VIDEO PLATFORMS Faced with these new uses, the business models of both pay and free channels are being challenged in a major way.  The number of pay-TV subscribers is falling, given the attractiveness of the new platforms' nonlinear programming, the wide selection of their premium subscription and the low cost of their offers. Pay-TV operators must therefore lower the prices of their subscriptions, which reduces their resources to invest in the most attractive programmes (sports, cinema, series).  For free channels, the duration of individual viewing time is beginning to decrease, and therefore their advertising revenues are stagnating due to the growing popularity of on-demand programmes, and widespread “binge watching” of web series. This stagnation in viewing time is in addition to competition from targeted Internet advertising, which is increasingly popular with advertisers but prohibited for linear Hertzian/over-the-air television. THE INADEQUACY OF CURRENT REGULATIONS IN THE FACE OF CHANGES IN THE SECTOR The new international offers, broadcast on the global Internet, are virtually unregulated, while for national incumbents, sector regulation is still based on the historical model of linear over-the-air broadcasting. Once protective for the entire sector, this regulation, which was particularly developed in France compared to other European countries, now imposes asymmetrical legal constraints, which weigh only on national incumbent stakeholders and limit their ability to adapt to market changes and meet consumer expectations.  As a result, incumbents cannot develop targeted advertising when they retransmit their programmes using ISPs.  Similarly, the development of VOD platforms enabling them to make the works they have financed available to consumers is constrained by obligations relating to investment in content. The new European regulation resulting from the recently adopted Audiovisual Media Services Directive (Directive Services de Média Audiovisuels) will make it possible to only very partially resolve this regulatory asymmetry, in particular because its application will require delicate coordination among the regulatory authorities of all Member States.  THE AUTORITÉ'S RECOMMENDATIONS: LOOSENING CONSTRAINTS ON TELEVISION CHANNELS In order to enable the incumbent stakeholders to better meet the challenges of the digital revolution, the Autorité advocates the liberalisation of obligations imposed exclusively on incumbents in terms of both advertising and programmes. Regarding advertising  Although the distinction between the television advertising market and the online advertising market remains, there is nevertheless a growing convergence between the two. Economic and technological developments make it necessary to review the existing regulations on television advertising, which are much more restrictive than those that currently apply to Internet stakeholders. Allow targeted advertising It is likely, in view of developments in the sector, that in the future online and television advertising will increasingly be alternatives between which advertisers will wish to choose. Today, the regulatory framework for television advertising does not allow this choice, particularly because it prevents TV channel advertising departments from offering advertisers targeted advertising. The Autorité proposes to allow channels to offer new forms of targeted advertising. Open up prohibited sectors Certain sectors are banned from television advertising in order to protect cultural diversity and the resources of other media. In view of the uncertainty about the effectiveness of the framework, insofar as these sectors make extensive use of digital advertising, the Autorité proposes to allow the broadcasting of advertising for cinema, publishing and mass retail promotional campaigns. Regarding programming French regulations require suppliers of TV channels to contribute to the financing of film and audiovisual production, some of which must qualify as “independent production”. It thus organises a system of compulsory, complex and differentiated investments according to television services and genres (cinema and audiovisual, stock and flow programmes, etc.), which hinders the suppliers of TV channels' freedom to build a programme schedule.  In addition to these production obligations, there is a quota (75%) necessarily reserved for “independent” works for which exploitation and broadcasting rights of broadcasters on the works they order are very closely limited for the benefit of the producer. Unlike international platforms, broadcasters cannot therefore exploit these rights abroad or on their own VOD platforms other than for a very limited time, even though they are quite often responsible for most of the financing of these works.  The suppliers of TV channels are therefore disadvantaged in that, on the one hand, they cannot vertically integrate as do digital platforms that buy production studios and, on the other hand, they cannot acquire exclusive long-term rights to exploit a work through various services in France and/or abroad and thus create the audiovisual services that are popular with viewers. In the absence of such a change, French audiovisual media services could be weakened by competition from digital platforms and no longer be able to continue financing French production, independent or otherwise, at significant levels. The Autorité therefore supports a relaxation of these provisions. Relaxation of obligations concerning investment in European and French works A pooling of obligations at the level of television groups must be introduced in order to preserve the necessary flexibility in the channels' investment choices and the differentiation of editorial guidelines within the group. In addition, a certain amount of pooling should be introduced between the “corridors” of audiovisual and film production obligations in order to enable TV channels to adapt to changing public tastes and market conditions. Review the conditions for the use of independent prduction Maintaining an obligation to use independent creation makes it possible to avoid excessive concentration, which undermines the availability of content and ultimately the diversity of the offer. But this can be done by limiting the definition of independence to the capital independence of the producer from the broadcaster, without setting the conditions for contractual negotiation on the distribution of rights.  Suppliers of TV channels who have financed the work should be able to negotiate broadcasting rights (e.g. for linear and VOD platforms) and marketing agreements directly with the producer, particularly for foreign markets, in order to compete on equal terms with other linear and nonlinear European and international stakeholders. Abolish “prohibited days” for films The Autorité recommends simplifying the conditions for broadcasting content by removing, or at least relaxing, the “prohibited days” rule, which prohibits the broadcasting of films on Wednesday and Friday evenings, Saturday all day and on Sundays before 8:30 p.m. This provision no longer makes sense as the films are available at any time on VOD platforms. Review the 1986 law on anti-concentration measures These provisions, which are in addition to the normal merger control framework, appear to be outdated due to economic developments in the sector. While safeguards guaranteeing pluralism remain necessary, the current provisions apply only to television operators and therefore exclude an increasingly significant proportion of content providers. The Autorité therefore calls for an overhaul of the framework. Reform as soon as possible what can be reformed in the decrees All these adaptations are urgent to avoid incumbent stakeholders becoming blocked in their efforts to adapt and gradually marginalised on the national and international markets, which will ultimately harm the entire sector. The Autorité therefore recommends that, without waiting for the law to intervene, the provisions relating to advertising and production obligations in the decrees of 27 March 1992 and 2 July 2010 be quickly reformed in line with the above recommendations.

Its main mission is to centralize customer requests and to assign them to available taxis, via a 24/7 radiotelephone central unit. Following an investigation on anticompetitive agreements led by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) in the Antibes Juan-les-Pins taxi sector, the Radio-taxi EIG of Antibes Juan-les-Pins was offered a settlement procedure, which it declined. The DGCCRF then referred the case to the Autorité de la concurrence, pursuant to Article L. 464-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce). Anticompetitive agreements implemented by the radio-taxi EIG Antibes Juan-les-Pins From 2008 to 2018, the EIG conditioned taxis' accession to the EIG to a sponsorship of two members and a unanimous vote. Furthermore, the EIG included grounds for exclusion in its constitutive contract aiming at preventing its members from developing their own client basis or an additional activity. Moreover, the IEG has applied this clause in practice by excluding one of its members for having developed an activity of LOTI (French law of orientation of national transport) and of VTC (car transport service provided by a chauffeur), in parallel with its taxi activity. Practices which led to prevent taxis from developing additional activities The Autorité has considered the accessing conditions to the EIG as non-objectives, non-transparent and discriminatory and that the exclusionary grounds could have dissuade members from expanding and from differentiating themselves from others in term of variety of service quality, thus preventing the rise of new modes of transport in the city and its area.  In light of these facts and the length (10 years) of the practices, the Autorité de la concurrence fined the EIG 75,000€. Local dimension practices Since 2008, the French Minister for the Economy and Finance has been vested with the power of injunctions and settlement for the ruling of local anticompetitive practices. It has thus the faculty, for anticompetitive practices affecting local markets and committed by companies with a sales revenue under 50 million euros on an individual level and under 200 million euros for all companies if several are concerned by the practices, to put an end to them and to fine them up to 150 000 euros per company (subjected to a limit of 5% of their sales revenue). > See the full text of Decision 19-D-05 of 28 March 2019 regarding practices implemented in the Antibes Juan-les-Pins taxi sector (in French)   Press contacts:  Bertille Gauthier +33 1 55 04 00 39 / Email Chloé Duretete + 33 1 55 04 01 20 / Email > This decision was submitted before the cour d'appel de Paris (pending case)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The complaint filed by the garage owners Three car garages referred a case to the Autorité de la concurrence regarding practices that would have been implemented by Hyundai. They criticized the car manufacturer for having refused or terminated in a discriminatory manner their approval as a Huyndai repairer, resulting in their exit from the network or not allowing them to integrate it. These three repairers also denounced a blanket exclusion policy for repairers who would not be at the same time distributors of the brand's vehicles. A network of authorized repairers with selection criteria in line with the regulation After the analysis of the referral and the verifications that have been carried out, it appears that the criteria established by Hyundai to integrate its network of authorised repairers comply with the requirements and recommendations of European law. In particular, these criteria are exclusively qualitative (professional qualifications of the reseller, the employees, the facilities...), without any element allowing to demonstrate that Hyundai would have sought to add quantitative selection criteria. Indeed, the elements presented and collected show that: Hyundai does not implement a form of geographic numerus clausus (or zoning) of its authorised repairers; Hyundai does not implement a blanket policy of excluding repairers who are not, at the same time, dealers for its brand. Terminations and refusals of approval that can only be anticompetitive when they are part of an overall plan The refusals of approval and terminations denounced by the plaintiffs corresponded to motivations which, if they were not communicated to the garages concerned, proved objective. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to show that beyond these refusals of approvals and terminations, the manufacturer would pursue a general anticompetitive plan. Having regard to these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence has rejected the referral on the ground of insufficient evidence.

During these dawn raids, two incidents were reported at two sites of the Akka Technologies Group: breaches of seals and alteration of electronic messaging functioning. Hindrances to the conduct of dawn raids  \t Breach of seals \t As with every unannounced visit to company headquarters, the Autorité 's officers sealed several offices to prevent access and prevent the disappearance of evidence during the inspection. Seals were thus placed in the morning on the doors of several offices of the Akka group by the Autorité and DGCCRF's officers. But when they wished to inspect one of these offices in the afternoon, they noted that the seal affixed had been broken. \t Alteration of electronic messaging functioning \t The Autorité 's officers also noted during the dawn raids that employees of the group had obstructed the receipt of e-mails on the messaging of one of their colleagues, particularly during the brief search of his computer. Serious behaviours The respect, by the companies visited, of the provisions relating to the intervention of the Autorité during a dawn raid is of crucial importance to guarantee the effectiveness of the powers of investigation granted to the Autorité de la concurrence to fulfill its mission of preserving the economic public order. A breach of seal or the damage to the integrity of an e-mail system may make the Autorité unable to bring to light, and therefore sanction, anti-competitive practices. They are therefore, in themselves, serious practices, constituting an obstruction within the meaning of V of Article L. 464-2 of the French Commercial Code. In light of these facts, the Autorité fined the Akka group 900,000 euros. This decision can not prejudge the culpability of the Akka Technologies group concerning the alleged practices that led to the dawn raids. Only an investigation into the merits of the case will, if necessary, establish or not its responsibility.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background The Autorité  issues today a decision sanctioning the Bureau commun de signification of Hauts-de-Seine (joint bureau of service (BCS)), which brings together all the bailiffs of the département Hauts de Seine, for establishing anticompetitive practices. The sanctioned practices consisted in setting discriminatory conditions for bailiffs wishing to join the bureau. Members of the BCS thus imposed on bailiffs who recently benefited from an establishment within the specific framework of the \"freedom of establishment\" provided for by the \"Macron Law\", and only to these, a discriminatory and highly prohibitive \"fixed entry fee\" of € 300,000. This discriminatory practice was such as to make the exercise of the profession more difficult for bailiffs who had benefited from the freedom of establishment and who were starting their activity. The BCS Hauts-de-Seine, did not dispute the facts or their qualification and applied for a settlement procedure. The fine was handed down to €120,000 and the BCS also made commitments to amend its articles of association. The service of a document The service of a document is a procedural aspect carried out by a bailiff, by which he informs a person of the content of a legal document within a framework defined by law. A certain number of documents or court decisions must be served, such as, in the case of judicial documents, subpoenas, or, in the case of extrajudicial documents, offers or requests for renewal of commercial lease or sales of goodwill. In the département of Hauts-de-Seine, the bailiffs have created, in 1988, the Bureau Commun de Signification des Hauts-de-Seine (Joint Bureau of Services (BCS)), which aims to reduce, for the benefit of its members and by their joint effort, the cost price of certain services regarding the exercise of their profession, and notably the service of documents by bailiffs. Within this structure, the clerks of the BCS thus collect the documents to be served in the offices that are members, deliver them and sort them, before proceeding to their service to the recipients on behalf of the bailiffs. The BCS Hauts-de-Seine consists of 25 bailiffs' offices representing 63 bailiffs or associates, that is to say all bailiffs of the département .  Discriminatory entry terms  The articles of association of the BCS Hauts-de-Seine have been the subject of several amendments to include, from 2015, stipulations regarding seniority conditions, the unanimous acceptance of new members by the partners and the payment by the latter of a financial contribution. The stipulations in question were then amended, in 2018, to include a condition regarding the payment of an entry fee of at least €300,000 (excluding VAT) for any new office resulting from the \"free establishment\" to access the BCS. These practices were intended to dissuade new entrants who benefited from the \"free establishment\" provided for by the \"Macron law\" to become members of the BCS Hauts-de-Seine. However, the membership in this structure is a condition for accessing or maintaining in the market of serving documents, and accordingly constitutes a decisive competitive advantage for its members, by reducing costs for members, improving the quality of the service rendered and providing immediate access to the market. Since 1988, the BCS has also introduced non-objective, non-transparent and discriminatory clauses dealing with the withdrawal and exclusion conditions of the BCS.  Provisions aiming to defeat the legislator's will to open up the profession These amendments intervened at the same time as the adoption and the entry into force of the law of 6 August 2015 (Macron Law) and aimed at defeating the will of the legislator to favor the creation of new bailiffs' offices, as well as the competition resulting from the arrival of new colleagues from the \"free establishment\". These practices are all the more serious as the département of Hauts-de-Seine was one of the département for which the potential of creating new offices was the most important. The BCS did not dispute the facts or their qualification and applied for the settlement procedure. Taking into account all these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence  has consequently handed down a fine of €120,000 to the BCS Hauts-de-Seine. The BCS has additionally committed to amending its articles of association to make them compliant with competition law.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background The law of 6 August 2015, socalled \"Macron law\" which has reformed regulated professions in order to introduce more competition and freedom of establishment has notably terminated the regulated tariff for real estate trading services from 1 March 2016. Since that date, there is no longer a tariff set by the public authorities and notaries freely set their rates for their real estate trading activities such as real estate agencies. GIE Notimo, which gathers around twenty notaries in the region Franche-Comté, has set up an agreement on prices, detrimental to competition law, so that the notaries of the region Franche-Comté set up a “tariff table” defined by GIE Notimo for real estate negotiation services. The chambre interdépartementale des notaires de Franche-Comté (interdepartmental chamber of the notaries of Franche-Comté) facilitated the commission of the offence, by actively making its secretariat available to the GIE and not reporting the illegal practice to the competent authorities. The GIE and the chambre interdépartementale des notaires de Franche-Comté have applied for a settlement procedure which was granted since they did not dispute neither the facts nor the qualification. As a consequence, the fine was handed down to respectively €250,000 and €45,000. GIE Notimo shares real estate assets of notaries, members of the network The GIE Notimo (Economic Interest Group) is a network of 21 notaries from the région Franche-Comté whose main mission is to allow its members to pool the real estate for which they hold a selling or renting mandate to provide customers with a richer ad base. It offers increased visibility to real estate listings of notaries which are published online on a dedicated website and application.  An agreement to obstruct the enforcement of the « Macron Law » In anticipation of the end of the regulated tariff, the GIE elaborated in the shadows, as from the second half of 2015, a single \"tariff grid\" for notaries of the network, with the aim of preventing the application of the Macron law and the free setting by each notary of his service rate. One of the members wrote in an email: \" The Macron law is doing its job and we must remain united. \" By making its secretariat available to the GIE Notimo, the chambre interdépartementale des notaires de Franche-Comté actively facilitated the agreement: e-mails, faxes and letters relating to the terms of implementation of the agreement were sent to members of the network from the addresses of the chamber.  An agreement whose users of Franche-Comté notarial services were victims It should be noted that the fixing by agreement of the tariff was in itself contrary to the competition law, but that, furthermore, the tariffs thus fixed induced a strong increase of the real estate negotiation fees compared to the regulated tariffs. On average, prices were 20% higher than those of other offices in the region. This practice is serious in that it occurred in a sector where the competitive space is severely limited by regulation and with the aim of defeating the reform wished by the legislator. Members of the agreement were aware of the probable illegality of the practices as indicated by the report of a meeting: \" Let us not forget that we could fall for unlawful agreement! \". Regarding the chamber, its role is all the more notable as it is the fact of an ordinal body held to a mission of consulting and control of the respect of the deontology.  Penalties imposed Parties have applied for a settlement procedure. In this context, the Autorité granted the request for settlement procedure, as the parties did not dispute neither the facts nor the applicable judicial qualification. It has fined GIE Notimo €250,000 and the Chambre interdépartementale des notaires de Franche-Comté €45,000.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité delivers a general diagnosis of competition in the French overseas territories. There have been positive developments since the 2009 opinion, particularly in the telecoms sector. However, consumer prices paid by the two million people living in the French overseas territories remain significantly higher than those in mainland France. The Autorité makes some twenty recommendations aimed at boosting competition in the French overseas territories. Background In June 2018 the government requested an opinion from the Autorité de la concurrence on the functioning of competition for the importation and distribution of consumer products in French overseas departments. The Autorité is today issuing its conclusions. Given the range of issues and the diversity of the regions concerned, the Autorité has put in place significant investigative resources to handle this request for an opinion. It set up a team of some ten staff members under the guidance of three deputy general rapporteurs, including the Autorité's officer for the overseas territories. The Autorité was able to rely on government services and in particular on the overseas units of the French Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF). It conducted a large number of hearings and analysed the many replies to the questionnaires sent to local actors. In its assessment, the first global analysis of competition since 2009, the Autorité focused on measuring the effects of the Law of 20 November 2012 on Economic Regulation in French Overseas Territories (known as the “Lurel Law”) and the Law of 28 February 2017 on Substantive Equality in French Overseas Territories. In this respect, the Autorité noted that the prohibition on import exclusivity has proved to be particularly useful, has been applied on several occasions and is beginning to produce structural effects. The Autorité also noted that there are substantial price differentials with mainland France, to varying degrees depending on the products and areas, but which may reach as much as 38% for food products in Martinique, for example. Competition law has proven a useful tool whose use must continue and which can be improved overseas for greater efficiency. In addition, it appears necessary to act on other mechanisms. The conclusions of the study thus notably reveal that dock dues contribute to increasing the cost of consumer goods but also add complexity. Also, among its recommendations, the Autorité invites the public authorities to simplify and unify the system for all regions, and to resolve certain specific pernicious effects. The Autorité also notes that there are numerous barriers to the development of online sales even while overseas consumers, like those in mainland France, seek to benefit from the advantages of e-commerce (attractive prices and access to products not available locally). It considers that these barriers must be removed in order to encourage the development of online sales in French overseas territories for the benefit of the consumer. French overseas territories are one of the priorities adopted by the Autorité in 2019, and is one of the themes of the strengthened partnership with the DGCCRF under the new cooperation protocol that binds them. In total, the Autorité issued in its opinion some twenty recommendations aimed at strengthening competition in the retail sector in French overseas territories. COMPARED TO MAINLAND FRANCE, SIGNIFICANT PRICE DIFFERENCES RANGING FROM 19% TO 38% FOR FOOD PRODUCTS The general level of consumer prices is 7% to 12.5% higher in French overseas departments than in mainland France .  These price differences are largely attributable to food products, which represent one of the main items of household consumption, and for which price differences are much larger and average between 19% and 38% depending on territories. MARGIN RATES SOMETIMES HIGH BUT WHICH DO NOT BY THEMSELVES EXPLAIN THE COST DIFFERENCES The Autorité has analysed the margin rates of the various stakeholders in retail distribution: distributors, shipping companies, ports, handlers, freight forwarders and wholesalers. It found that the margins of some stakeholders are higher than those in mainland France, indicating limited, but real room for manoeuvre. However, the Autorité has not identified any margin variances that alone would explain a significant share of the price differences with mainland France. On the other hand, it is the accumulation of margins of the stakeholders in the entire consumer chain that can explain some of the price differences with mainland France. HAVING RECOURSE TO WHOLESALE IMPORTERS AND DOCK DUES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS If the margins made by distributors alone do not account for most of the price differences between French overseas departments and regions and mainland France, two main factors, however, largely explain these differences for imported products: - forwarding costs for imported products, related to geographical distance (16% of the cost of a product for a distributor). They include maritime transport, dock dues, various taxes and costs related to the use of different service providers for imports. On average dock dues are the most expensive cost item in forwarding costs; - recourse to wholesale importers (16% of the cost of a product for a distributor). These forwarding costs and the use of wholesale importers, passed on by distributors in the final price to the consumer, therefore partly explain the price differences with mainland France. While the use of wholesale importers is often necessary for distributors given the services provided on their behalf (storage, stocking and advertising), the forwarding costs, mainly consisting of dock dues, are unavoidable. This tax, set by the French overseas territories, is levied on goods imported and produced in French overseas departments. Goods produced in each collectivity may be exempt from this tax, the objective being to encourage the consumption of local products over that of imported products. Initially designed to protect local production through rate differentials, dock dues are now a significant resource for local authorities and have sometimes deviated from the initial objective, for example when they apply to products that are not locally produced. The complexity of the rates applied and the mechanisms implemented were identified for their adverse effects on consumers, distributors and local businesses. In addition, the average sea-faring rates can be very disparate depending on the territories. According to available data, the average rate in French Guiana, for example, is three times higher than the average rate in La Reunion (average rate of 15% in French Guiana, 7% in Guadeloupe and Martinique, and 4% in La Réunion). Recommendation: simplify and harmonise the dock dues system French and European authorities must decide on the renewal of the dock dues system before the end of 2020. While it is not within the Autorité's competence to decide whether to maintain or abolish this tax, it believes it would be useful for public authorities to consider simplifying the rate grid for dock dues and making it consistent for areas that are geographically close. It also proposes to exempt products for which there is no equivalent in local production. Finally, it suggests taking into account the interests of local companies that buy products subject to dock dues for their business without benefiting from an exemption. A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED RETAIL SECTOR The retail sector in the French overseas departments and regions appears to be more concentrated overall than in mainland France, although there are differences by area. Some representatives of local authorities and associations have indicated that the small size of the overseas territories would encourage the convergence of offers and that the distributors in the French overseas departments and regions would not be engaged in a \"price war\" similar to what can be seen in mainland France. Merger control allows the Autorité to examine takeovers of supermarkets or hypermarkets and to ensure that competitive intensity is maintained. This has been done, particularly in Martinique recently, with the adoption of innovative measures to maintain competition between different retailers. However, merger control cannot be used to intervene in highly concentrated areas. If the structural injunction , to force a retailer to sell stores – this mechanism is however accompanied by very restrictive conditions, which has led the Autorité to propose a relaxation of this mechanism in order to facilitate its implementation and to better respond to the situation of high concentration in French overseas territories.  Recommendation: facilitate implementation of the structural injunction The Autorité recommends amending the current wording of the provision of the French Code of Commercial Law ( Code de commerce ) governing the structural injunction in order to clarify and facilitate the conditions for its implementation. QUALITY AND PRICE PROTECTION HELPS TO FIGHT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING Quality and price protection is based on a location-sensitive list of everyday consumer products (examples: ham, beans, rice, rice, laundry, dish washing liquid, toothpaste, etc.) which must be sold at a reasonable price. It is the result of an annual negotiation between the various economic stakeholders, under the supervision of a government representative. All stakeholders welcome the principle of the system, which is aligned with the fight against the high cost of living. Quality and price protection thus made it possible to observe significant price reductions in 2019 in all regions.  While quality and price protection is a tool that has found its place, it nevertheless faces several difficulties in its implementation: insufficient visibility among consumers, too many objectives and unequal participation by stakeholders. Recommendation: Strengthen the effectiveness of quality and price protection In particular, the Autorité proposes to extend the system upstream to stakeholders other than retail chains and to set up a price comparison system in order to give consumers better visibility of the system. It also proposes that its objectives be better targeted, according to the intentions and needs of each location (e.g. seeking low prices or enhancing local production). IMPORT AGREEMENTS  The 2012 Lurel Law prohibited exclusive import agreements in order to intensify price competition between retailers. The Autorité has already had to fine suppliers and distributors who had not put an end to these exclusive distribution agreements on five previous occasions and has seen local stakeholders become more familiar with the new rules. The law has also forced suppliers to implement competitive tendering procedures much more frequently in choosing their wholesale importers. The Autorité also notes that a significant share of overseas distribution companies is also present as wholesale importers on the wholesale market. This vertical integration (presence of a stakeholder at different levels of the chain) is likely to raise competition risks, in particular as regards the allocation of commercial cooperation budgets (price advantages granted by the supplier to the distributor for the promotion of his products on shelves or in catalogues). An integrated stakeholder could indeed be encouraged to favour its retailers to the detriment of competitors. Recommendation: strengthen the rules in French overseas territories to prevent discrimination against stakeholders in cases of vertical integration The Autorité recommends introducing a new provision in the French Code of Commercial Law (Code de commerce) that would make it possible to fine an integrated stakeholder for de facto exclusivity that discriminates against its third-party customers in order to promote internal sales within the group. TRANSPORT COSTS THAT CAN WEIGH ON PRODUCTS WITH LOW ADDED VALUE In general, maritime transport costs represent a limited share of the purchase cost of imported products (less than 5% on average excluding fuel and handling). In recent years, these costs have tended to increase, in part due to higher handling and fuel costs. As freight services do not depend on the value of the goods, products with low added value, such as a bottle of water, are more affected than products with high added value (a bottle of champagne for example). Thus, the cost price of mineral water more than doubles when the cost of freight is considered. An explanation for this is that containers are billed at fixed cost independent of the value of the product. It therefore applies in the same way to a bottle of water and a bottle of champagne. In the end, including all forwarding costs (freight + dock dues + local transport), the price of the bottle of mineral water is multiplied by 4, compared to 1.3 for the bottle of champagne. MINIMALLY COMPETITIVE LOCAL PRODUCTION Local production accounts for a quarter of consumer goods but remains generally uncompetitive compared to imported products. Despite the forwarding costs and taxation specific to French overseas departments and regions (government assistance and dock dues), these schemes do not generate any obvious downward effect on prices. While some sectors, such as bananas, sugar and rum, do export, they are not enough to offset the trade imbalance. This lack of competitiveness is largely due to the narrow markets in French overseas territories and the high number of farms, which prevent local producers from achieving economies of scale.  Recommendation: structure the sector and develop quality labels The Autorité recommends pursuing sector structuring and encouraging differentiation of local products through quality labels. E-COMMERCE: A FACTOR IN OPENING UP AND FIGHTING AGAINST THE HIGH COST OF LIVING BUT WHICH IS DEVELOPING SLOWLY The e-commerce is potentially a factor in opening up the populations of French overseas departments and regions and combating the high cost of living. It is also an indirect vehicle for developing local employment with the creation of logistics activities. The market of the French overseas departments and regions also has considerable business interest, with individual markets having several hundred thousand inhabitants. However, despite the opportunities it presents, the e-commerce sector in French overseas territories is lagging behind in its development, with a significant number of retailers operating in mainland France absent from the overseas territories. Of the dozens of major online retailers consulted by the Autorité during the investigation, only one third offer delivery in the French overseas departments and regions. This situation is mainly due to the existence of strong barriers and constraints, both logistical (delivery costs and times, return of products, after-sales service) and customs (dock dues in particular). Thus, shipping costs increase the price paid by the consumer and discourage overseas consumers from ordering online. For example, the following costs were observed on some online sales sites:  Delivery times are also longer than in mainland France: from 3 to 27 days compared to an average of 5.3 days in mainland France. The exercise of the right of withdrawal, which allows a consumer to return a product without giving any justification within 14 days of delivery, is also more difficult to implement, as some sellers leave the costs of reshipment to the buyers, which may discourage buyers from ordering online. Some retailers prefer not to sell overseas rather than having consumers pay for the return and delivery costs. The implementation of the guarantee of conformity, which in the event notably of a defect gives the consumer a right to the repair, replacement or reimbursement of the product can be complicated. While this right, unlike the right of withdrawal, must not entail any costs for the consumer, it appears that some retailers do not respect the law to the letter, making the buyer contribute to the costs of return or reshipment. In addition, consumers are not or poorly informed about the payment of dock dues when ordering online. They complain about the lack of transparency and advance knowledge of the amount of dock dues to be paid. In addition, it is questionable whether it is appropriate to apply this tax to products that do not compete with a local option (for example, for certain electronic devices), even though one of the reasons for the existence of this tax is to protect local production. Finally, European regulation 2018/302 prohibits geoblocking based in particular on the customer's place of residence. Thus, consumers in French overseas territories must be able to freely access e-commerce sites and benefit from non-discriminatory conditions compared to mainland consumers. Recommendation: encourage online sales The Autorité proposes, in particular: -encouraging group shipment of parcels by allowing a single customs formality to be completed in order to reduce delivery costs. -verifying that retailers do not charge consumers for the cost of returning a product under the guarantee of conformity. -adapting consumer law in order to oblige online retailers to clearly display applicable taxes and dock dues. -studying adoption of a reduced and single rate for dock dues for products sold online. -ensuring that there is no geoblocking by transposing the provisions of the European regulation into French law. - adopt a national regulation transposing the provisions of the European regulation on the geoblocking, taking into account the uncertainty as to the applicability of this text to the situations involving an overseas consumer.  The Autorité's actions in French overseas territories Since 2009, the Autorité de la concurrence has intensified its actions overseas in fighting the high cost of living. In numerical terms, these include: •  28 litigation decisions, representing 10% of the decisions taken over the past 10 years; •  41 merger control decisions and major commitments required to protect competition in French overseas territories (Canal+/Mediaserv, Altice/SFR-SRR) and which are closely monitored (€15 million fine imposed on Altice for noncompliance with commitments made at the time of the sale of Only); •  12 opinions regarding various subjects and proposing reforms for the benefit of the consumer, in particular to lower construction prices, tariffs for regulated professions, fuels, telephone calls, heavy vehicle technical control; •  €420 million impact on the economy of the French overseas territories, including €210 million as a result of fines imposed by the Autorité. It notably issued a recent opinion on building materials in Réunion and Mayotte in which it made recommendations to reduce the cost of building social housing and public engineering works. In addition, in the last few months, it has carried out dawn raids in several companies in the inter-island air transport and retail sectors. The evidence collected is currently being examined by the Autorité's investigation services. INSEE 2015 figure. Since the lowering of the notification thresholds, introduced by the Lurel Law, the Autorité's supervision of the sector has tightened. In this respect, it has also issued several decisions making these acquisitions conditional in order to guarantee price competition in the catchment areas concerned. See Decision 18-DCC-142 of 23 August 2018 regarding the acquisition of sole control of SDRO and Robert II by Groupe Bernard Hayot. The structural injunction makes it possible to order transfers of assets (stores) in the retail trade if three cumulative conditions are met: the retailer is in a dominant position, it has committed an abuse and it practices high prices or margins.

        "full_text_press_realease": "At the government's request, the Autorité proposes a method to assess the impact on competition of extending industry sector collective agreements and conventions Since the 2017 labour law reform, the Code du travail (French Labour Code) has expressly provided for the possibility of the Labour Ministry to refuse the extension of an industry sector collective agreement for “ general interest reasons, particularly for excessive anticompetitive effects ” (L. 2261 25). Where appropriate, it can refer the matter to a group of experts tasked with assessing the “economic and social” effects of these agreements (L. 2261 27 1 of the Labour Code). In this context, the government requested an opinion from the Autorité , inviting it to analyse the issues for market competition related to this extension mechanism, but also to list indicators that could be used to identify the risks extension might pose for competition. As the basis for its analysis, the Autorité obtained submissions from the different stakeholders involved in collective bargaining at industry sector level (public authorities, experts and social partners). The insight it offers is based in particular on its technical expertise in anticompetitive practices and by the case law and doctrine to date of its review courts.  The Autorité's main findings Although the extension of agreements undoubtedly plays an important social role and regulates labour relations between companies in the same industry sector, the mechanism can also have a negative impact on competition. As a result of its analysis, the Autorité has made a number of findings: From a social point of view , extending industry sector agreements plays a key role by ensuring social protection for workers is the same across a whole industry sector and by regulating the functioning of the labour market, particularly by limiting “social dumping”. The social partners consider that, if a company seeks a competitive advantage by applying less favourable social rules to its employees than those of its competitors, this constitutes “unfair social competition”. The extension mechanism can also compensate for low unionisation rates among employees and low employer organisation coverage rates in France (i.e. the proportion of companies that are members of employer organisations and the proportion of employees in those companies), particularly in very small, small and medium-sized enterprises (VSEs/SMEs). In France, approximately 95% of collective agreements made at industry sector level are extended, which means that employment rules and social protections negotiated collectively apply to all employees and companies in the industry sector, regardless of whether they belong to an employee trade union or an employer organisation. For more details, see the Opinion from paragraph 61. From an economic point of view , the experts agree that the mechanism can reduce inequality between employees. However, the studies also found that there was a need for regulation, given the potentially damaging consequences of agreement extensions, macroeconomically, for employment levels in the sector and for competitive intensity in the goods and services markets concerned according to a microeconomic analysis. For more details, see the Opinion from paragraph 70. The impact on competition due to the extension of an agreement, where this appears necessary, needs to be assessed on a “case-by-case” basis, taking account of the state of competition between the companies potentially affected by the extended agreement, and weighing the social objectives of the extension and the imperatives of free competition against each other. In practice, there are few examples where free competition has been harmed by the extension of collective agreements. Case law and doctrine to date and the Autorité's past decisions, however, are a valuable guide for defining indicators to identify agreements that could be intended to or could have the effect of restricting market access or hindering the free exercise of competition if they are extended. At present, few if any analyses are carried out prior to the extension of an agreement, to quantify the economic cost of generalised application of the agreement to non-signatory companies. The legislative and economic impact of such an agreement, extended by order of the Minister of Labour, could justify prospective studies like this being done as part of the collective bargaining process. Finally, a lack of coherence in statistics for a relevant business sector, industry sector and market makes it difficult to use statistical data to assess the effects of extension on employment and competition. Proposal 1 Useful indicators for assessing risks to competition The Autorité suggests using three categories of indicators to identify agreements that would harm competition should they be extended. 1. Indicators related to the subject areas addressed by the agreement and its content Detailed examination should be made of agreements that: cover subjects not limited to simple application of legal requirements to improve working conditions but that affect relationships between economic stakeholders; cover minimum pay for different grades or classification tables; change the way working time is organised; specify the rules for passing on employment contracts when businesses are transferred; recommend pension providers and medical insurance providers; introduce new requirements for training or obtaining vocational qualifications; regulate employee mobility. For more details about the use of these indicators, see the Opinion from paragraph 111. 2. Indicators related to the functioning of the sector to which the agreement will apply The following are likely to harm competition: monopolies, oligopolies or companies that hold a dominant market position; sectors in which companies hold exclusive rights and operate in the competitive market; markets where there is asymmetry in the capital intensity of companies; markets characterised by low levels of trade between EU member states or limited international openness; markets in which technological innovation is important; sectors where there is a shortage of labour. For more details about the use of these indicators, see the Opinion from paragraph 115. 3. Indicators related to the conditions of negotiating the agreement The following situations should attract the assessor's attention: low employer organisation coverage in an industry sector; low rates of signature of agreements by SMEs; the industry sector consists mainly of VSEs/SMEs; the industry sector consists mainly of subcontractors; the industry sector consists of companies likely to have diverging interests. For more details about the use of these indicators, see the Opinion from paragraph 138.  Proposal 2 Consider the development of impact studies during collective bargaining to assess the economic cost of the possible extension of the agreement Because of difficulties with quantifying the economic cost of some labour rules negotiated by social partners, the Autorité recommends that impact studies be carried out as part of the negotiating process for companies that are not signatories to an agreement (or more specifically for VSEs/SMEs or startups). Proposal 3 Consider adapting the statistical system to facilitate the analysis of the effects of extending industry sector collective agreements on competition   La difficulté d'utilisation de l'outil statistique tel que le Système Unifié de Statistiques d'Entreprises (« SUSE »), dans le cadre de l'analyse des effets de l'extension des accords collectifs sur la concurrence, devrait conduire à ce que les données de statistique publique permettent de mieux appréhender les secteurs d'activité, branches professionnelles et marchés pertinents. Pour consulter le détail des recommandations formulées par l'Autorité, voir à partir du § 109 de l'avis.  Because of the difficulty of using statistical tools such as the unified system for business statistics (SUSE) when analysing the effects on competition of extending collective agreements, public statistical data should be adapted to give a clearer picture of the situation in the relevant business sectors, industry sectors and markets. To read the Autorité's recommendations in more detail, see the Opinion from paragraph 109. Opinion 19-A-13 of 11 July 2019 See full text of the opinion Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence rejects, in the absence of solid evidence, the referral filed by the online content hosting service Dstorage (1fichier.com) regarding practices of several companies in the payment methods sector, notably the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, Visa and Mastercard. 1fichier.com: a popular and controversial download site The company Dstorage operates the website 1fichier.com, a popular online hosting and file sharing service. Dstorage gives access to its service with free offers and paid offers. The site 1fichier.com is regularly described by reports and studies, both French and foreign, as allowing access to copies of video games, movies or series that would be illegal. The host service considered that the internal operating rules of the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires (\"GIE CB\"), Visa and Mastercard, were constituent of an agreement Dstorage indicates it has faced, especially since 2015, from payment service providers, a large number of refusals to contract or unilateral breaches of \"distance selling\" contract. It has thus been prevented from being able to offer its users an online payment service by credit card, in particular for the payment of subscriptions. It lodged a complaint with the Autorité de la concurrence with a request for emergency measures. This complaint concerned 33 companies, a large majority of payment service providers, banking or online payment companies, as well as GIE CB, Mastercard and Visa. Dstorage believed that the internal operating rules of the GIE CB, Visa and Mastercard, which are binding on establishments offering credit card payment services, are at the origin of these refusals and terminations and constitute an agreement. It argues that these rules are decisions of business associations that support an anti-competitive agreement. The internal operating rules of GIE CB, Visa and Mastercard aim to prevent any collaboration with sites providing illegal services The operating rules of the GIE CB, Visa and Mastercard bind their members to control the activity of the merchants with whom they sign a distance selling contract, in particular to identify the activities deemed to be at risk and to avoid the use of a payment card for the remuneration of illegal activities. These rules therefore have the sole objective, in a national and international context of combating the dissemination of illegal content, such as works or audiovisual files infringing copyright, to prevent the use of means of payment to fund an illegal file hosting activity. Their purpose is therefore not to undermine competition, but to draw the attention of the member institutions to the potentially unlawful activity of traders with whom they enter distance selling contracts. The examination of the operating rules of the GIE CB, Visa and Mastercard makes it possible to observe that these rules do not ipso facto lead to the termination of distance selling contracts for customers considered to be at risk. It is only in the absence of regularisation that the termination occurs, each establishment retaining a certain degree of appreciation. A parallelism of behavior between competitors The denounced practices reflect a parallelism of competitors' behavior making autonomous decisions based on information available to all and according to a specific economic rationality. Therefore, there is no sufficiently compelling evidence of a concerted practice that would distort or restrict competition. In view of all these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence rejected the referral of Dstorage, as well as its request for an interim measure.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence hands out fines to the Ordre des Architectes for having distributed and enforced a fee schedule that architects had to apply in their responses to calls for tender to manage public works contracts. Background Following investigation reports by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), the Autorité today issued a decision imposing a fine of €1.5 million on the Ordre des Architectes for having, through its regional councils in Hauts-de-France, Centre-Val de Loire, Occitanie and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, implemented anticompetitive practices. They consisted in setting up, distribute and enforce a fee schedule applicable to architects responding to calls for tender for public works contracts in a sector where fees are unregulated. The distribution of this schedule was accompanied by a “fee policy”, retaliatory measures against architects who did not comply with these instructions and contacts with public contracting authorities to dissuade them from contracting with architects offering fees considered “too low”. The Ordre also circulated, through its national council, a standard form to the regional councils to use to refer an architect or architectural firm to the regional disciplinary boards in the event they failed to comply with the unlawful schedule. The Autorité also imposed a fine of one euro on several architectural firm and architects as well as an association of architects who participated in the agreement through denunciations to the Ordre of their colleagues who did not comply with the “fee schedule”. Managing public works Management of public works consists in carrying out, on behalf of a public contracting authority (municipality, community of municipalities, département, etc.), a project of works under conditions of time, quality and/or costs defined in advance by a set of specifications. As managers of public works, architects are entrusted by the public contracting authority with the design of the project, the preparation of the consultation file of the companies, the supervision of the proper execution of the works and the role of interface with the companies entrusted with the execution of the works. Their fees are not regulated by the public authority, thus ensuring competition on the market. Distribution of fee instructions to combat dumping Starting in 2013, four regional councils (Hauts-de-France, Centre-Val de Loire, Occitanie and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur) distributed to their members a method of calculating fees in order to combat an alleged dumping by certain architects described as “anti-collegial”. The president of the conseil regional de l'ordre Centre-Val de Loire thus declared \" it is disloyal compared to the other colleagues who bid for this contract because he made a price too low. Making a price too low to make sure of winning a contract is an anticompetitive and disloyal practice to colleagues \". In order to combat these “acts of unfair competition”, the Ordre, through its regional councils, deflected the purpose of the guide for the Interministerial Mission for the Quality of Public Buildings (MIQCP) - intended to help public authorities evaluate the estimated budget for project management fees - by using this document as a reference to calculate architects' fees, and by encouraging architects to fix their fees according to the ranges recommended by the guide without taking into account their actual costs.  A “fee policy” to ensure compliance with instructions  In order to ensure compliance with the fee instructions thus issued to architects, the Ordre des Architectes organised a monitoring of compliance with the “schedule”. Its national council adopted and distributed a standard form to facilitate referral to the regional disciplinary boards in the event an architect applied fees considered to be particularly low. Its Hauts-de-France regional council also created an association specifically dedicated to identifying irregularities related to fees in the framework of responses to calls for tender. A website was thus created to enable architects whose bids were rejected to report the allegedly excessively low fees charged by their colleagues chosen for the tender. The regional councils also increased the number of pre-litigation and litigation proceedings against architects who did not comply with fee instructions. Several architectural firms and architects, for their part, adhered to this fee policy by denouncing to the regional councils the fee applied by their winning colleagues. Lastly, the regional councils had numerous unwarranted contacts with public contracting authorities, unlawfully alerting them to the “risks”, both legal and technical, which, in their opinion, would result from negotiating excessively low fees with architects, and encouraging them to relaunch the procedures and sometimes even abandoning the construction of the public building. Practices with real effects Architects suspected of offering too low a fee were subject to pre-disciplinary and disciplinary proceedings, in some cases involving sanctions (reprimand or temporary suspension). The Ordre's various contacts with public contracting authorities discouraged some communities from choosing architects offering moderate fees and, in some cases, called into question contracts already awarded or under negotiation, resulting in an additional expenditure of public funds to the detriment of the taxpayer. For example, in the Hauts-de-France region, the low-income housing association in Douai terminated a framework agreement after being contacted by the Ordre's regional council; the community of municipalities of 2 Sources discontinued the contract for its educational complex “in the face of criticism from the Ordre” and had to relaunch its call for tenders, thus incurring an additional cost of €200,000; the municipality of Linselles, for its part, was repeatedly threatened with litigation by the Ordre's regional council if it failed to change its plan to build a school; and, finally, the award of the dojo project for the municipality of Hazebrouck was appealed to the administrative court by the same regional council. These practices by a professional association are serious The practices concerned are all the more serious since they were undertaken by the Ordre des Architectes, the initiator and principal abettor of the agreement, while it benefited from undeniable moral authority both among its members and public contracting authorities. These practices have moreover affected local authorities responsible for public funds, often of modest size and with limited ability to invest. On the other hand, with regard to the architects and architectural firms in question, the Autorité held that the Ordre's institutional communication could have caused confusion among those professionals as to their ethical obligations concerning the fixing of fees. In light of all these aspects, the Autorité imposed a fine of €1.5 million on the Ordre des Architectes and fined each architect and architectural firm that participated in the agreement, as well as the association of architects affiliated with the Ordre's regional council in Hauts-de-France, €1. The decision may be appealed before the Paris Court of Appeal. The investigation continues in other regions of France The investigation reports sent by the DGCCRF for this case concerned four of the eighteen regions of France. Architects and public authorities who believe they have suffered similar practices in other regions of France are invited to report this to the general rapporteur of the Autorité de la concurrence at the following address: Contact  Decision 19-D-19 of 30 September 2019 See full text of the decision Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The Astre group comprises small and mid-size road transport companies. It is organised in two entities: Astre Coopérative, which ensures compliance with the group's internal rules of procedure, recruits new members, and proposes services and tools for members Astre Commercial, which sells transport and logistics services from members of the group by responding to consultations and calls for tender by key client accounts. The Astre group organised customer allocation The Astre group introduced in its internal rules of procedure, articles of association and membership agreement non-competition clauses whereby its members, known as Astriens , were forbidden from prospecting “listed clients”, i.e. clients identified as belonging to another member. Even after leaving the group, former members were required to comply with the non-competition clause for one year. Although these clauses, introduced in 1997, were removed in March 2016, the non-competition obligation continued for calls for tender. The group effectively intervened on numerous occasions to request that its members refrain from responding to requests from clients of other members, and established a priority rule. According to this rule, for calls for tender issued by a client already working with members of the group, Astre only sent this call for tender to said members, who were considered the best positioned to submit a bid. The system also included a monitoring and sanctions mechanism with a points-based licence A points-based licence system was introduced. Each member had a “label” with 12 points that could be removed in the event of failure to comply with the obligations set out in the internal rules of procedure, especially the non-competition clause. Losing all points resulted in withdrawal of the label and exclusion from the Astre group. Several instances led to sanctions, varying from a loss of points accompanied by financial penalties to exclusion from the Astre group. Serious practices Customer sharing is a serious practice in itself. In this case, it consolidated the positions of each transport company and strongly limited their commercial independence, thereby reducing alternatives for clients and price competition. This practice took place over more than 20 years, and was not contested by the Astre group, which wanted to benefit from the settlement procedure. The Autorité accepted its request and, given all this information, issued a €3.8 million fine distributed as follows: Astre Coopérative €1.3 M Astre Commercial €2.5 M  Reminders of certain principles relating to grouping and settlement - Competition law and grouping  Competition law prohibits independent companies from agreeing among themselves to reduce competition, set prices, trade terms, or allocate customers or markets.  The fact that independent companies join a professional group does not prevent them from complying with these rules, as the Autorité already pointed out in fining such practices as for example in the flour sector ( 12-D-09 ), the bakery ( 19-D-15 ), taxis ( 19-D-05 ) or the professional kitchens installation ( 16-D-05 , 16-D-06 , 16-D-26 ). - The transaction The Autorité recalls that by requesting a settlement, a company undertakes to make all sufficient guarantees to stop the contentious practice as soon as possible, i.e. upon signature of the settlement report. This compliance with the law does not constitute a commitment that may give rise to a reduction of the fine. Furthermore, the Autorité recalls that by signing the settlement report, the company considers that the planned range of fines is compatible with its financial position. It therefore cannot subsequently maintain that the planned fine is incompatible with its financial position, unless said position has deteriorated since signature of the report.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The process of progressively opening up the two professions, which are scheduled to merge into the new profession of commissioner of justice in 2022, is producing encouraging results and should continue. Pursuant to the “Macron Law”, the Autorité is making new recommendations to encourage the gradual establishment of new professionals. Out of the 99 establishment areas across the country, the Autorité has identified 32 free-establishment areas for bailiffs and 3 free-establishment areas for judicial auctioneers. It recommends establishing 100 new bailiffs and 3 new judicial auctioneers in private practice by 2022. Background Pursuant to Law 2015-990 of 6 August 2015 on Growth, Activity and Equal Economic Opportunities (“Macron Law”), the Autorité de la concurrence today proposed to the Ministers of Justice and the Economy revised maps of establishment areas for two professions: court bailiffs and judicial auctioneers. These maps are accompanied by recommendations relating to the pace of creation of new offices for each of these professions during the period 2020-2022. The law provides that these maps be revised every two years. The first maps were adopted based on proposals by the Autorité dated 20 December 2016 ( Opinion 16-A-25 / press release for bailiffs and Opinion 16-A-26 / press release for judicial auctioneers ) by joint decrees issued by the French Ministers of the Economy and Justice on 28 December 2017 (published in the Official Journal of the French Republic ( Journal Officiel ). The validity of these maps will expire on 30 December 2019. Initial appointment goals established on maps adopted in 2017 have not yet been achieved The previous maps identified 64 regulated-establishment areas (“orange areas”) and 35 free-establishment areas (“green areas”) for bailiffs and 63 orange areas and 36 green areas for judicial auctioneers.  The aforementioned decrees of 28 December 2017 set a goal of 202 appointments of bailiffs and 41 appointments of judicial auctioneers.  In practice, despite the very high number of candidacies (over 2,400 for bailiffs and 540 for judicial auctioneers) and the strong mobilisation of the Chancellery's services in order to process the applications, the duration and complexity of the appointment procedure were such that this goal will probably not be achieved by December 2019. Increased staffing and a higher percentage of women The jobs created in the wake of the reform have served to stem the fall in the number of bailiffs in private practice and to increase the number of judicial auctioneers in private practice to above 2014 levels while ensuring a stronger female presence in both professions (the share of female bailiffs has increased to 39.7% in 2019 compared to 31.2% in 2014 and the share of female judicial auctioneers has increased to 26.8% in 2019 compared to 23.5% in 2016). Unequal impacts on the age of practising professionals While the reform has brought about a lowering of the average age of bailiffs (the average age of newly appointed professionals is 43.5 for men and 35 for women, which has led to a lowering of the average age in the profession to 48 [1] ), the average age of judicial auctioneers has increased slightly from 52.9 in 2014 to 53.7 in 2019. The Autorité recommends the appointment of 100 new bailiffs and 3 new judicial auctioneers to take up positions in private practice over the next two years By 2026, the Autorité considers that there could potentially be between 450 and 500 establishments of new bailiffs in private practice and between 25 and 30 establishments of new judicial auctioneers in private practice.  To achieve this goal, and in light of the relevant information collected during the investigation designed to analyse short-term developments in the activity of the two professions, the Autorité  recommends that the government create additional offices for the free establishment of 100 new bailiffs in 32 establishment areas and 3 new judicial auctioneers in three establishment areas during the period of validity of the next map (2020-2022) , which should be added to the carry-over from the recommendations that were not achieved during 2020-2022. The pace of creation adopted is therefore a little slower than for the previous map (2018-2020). In parallel, the Autorité has also defined 67 and 97 orange areas respectively in which it did not in principle identify any current need for the creation of offices for bailiffs and judicial commissioners. For bailiffs, nine former green areas (including Finistère and Isère, for example) saw one or two offices created in accordance with the 2018-2020 map with the effect that the supply of bailiff services now matches demand. For judicial auctioneers, the national network has been strengthened with several former “green areas” on the first map becoming orange areas on the second map. These mainly rural areas (such as Sarthe, Doubs, Somme and Ain) have had one office created in accordance with the previous map. Lastly, to accompany its proposed map, the Autorité has issued a series of six recommendations which are specifically designed to improve implementation of the reform and thereby ensure the free establishment of bailiffs and judicial auctioneers.  [1] French Ministry of Justice, DACS, Pôle d'évaluation de la justice civile, Statistique sur la profession d'avocat – situation au 1 janvier 2019 . I - A second step in the application of the provisions of the Macron law  \t The legislative and regulatory framework \t Public and ministerial officials, bailiffs and judicial auctioneers are appointed by the Minister of Justice to an existing, vacant or newly created office. The Macron Law introduced a principle of regulated freedom of establishment in order to lower barriers of entry to these professions and to adapt territorial coverage to the needs of the economy. Within the framework of this system, the Autorité 's mission [1] consists in proposing to the government, every two years, maps [2] that identify areas where the establishment of bailiffs and judicial auctioneers is free (“green areas”) [3] and areas where establishment is regulated (“orange areas”) [4] . The first maps proposed by the Autorité within the framework of Opinions 16-A-25 and  16-A-26 of 20 December 2016 were enacted via two joint decrees of the Ministers of Justice and the Economy of 28 December 2017, which defined respectively 35 and 36 green areas (out of a total of 99 areas) in which 202 new liberal bailiffs and 41 new liberal judicial auctioneers were called to establish themselves by the end of 2019.  \t State of supply and assessment of the creation of offices  \t Before formulating new recommendations for 2020-2022, the Autorité carried out an inventory of the state of supply and the establishment of the relevant professionals. It made a quantitative and qualitative assessment of supply over the period 2014-2018 based on the latest available consolidated economic and financial data. Based on this inventory, the Autorité makes the following observations: As regards the number of offices , 2018 saw the first net creation of offices for over 10 years with 55 bailiff and 28 judicial auctioneer offices created in accordance with the aforementioned law of 6 August 2015. These recent creations served to stem the fall in the number of private-practice bailiffs without, however, restoring the numbers to 2014 levels; as regards judicial auctioneers, however, the numbers of professionals in private practice surpassed the 2014 level;  A fairly uniform distribution of turnover among bailiffs , which is stable for the period overall, compared to the distribution of turnover among judicial auctioneers, which varies greatly from area to area and which has fallen overall by 5% on average since 2016 ; A fairly high margin rate for bailiffs despite a slight [5] dip compared to the period 2012-2014, which equates to the fall in the margin rate for judicial auctioneers [6] for the same period ;  An enhanced national network due to the creation of bailiff offices in areas that had fewer than 10 offices, in Meuse and Indre for example, and the creation of judicial auctioneer offices in areas that previously had none, including Ain and Southern Corsica; More choice for clients and better opportunities for qualified bailiffs and judicial auctioneers . From a qualitative point of view, the arrival of new professionals in private practice has had a beneficial effect on supply, with greater choice for clients and closer proximity, as well as the creation of opportunities for qualified professionals who until recently worked as ministerial officers or were seeking employment and who can now more easily access the free practice of their profession.  II - Quantitative recommendations of the Autorité for 2020-2022: 100 new bailiffs and 3 new judicial auctioneers For its work to revise the map, the Autorité decided to renew the methodology used to draw up the first maps for both professions, which had been validated in all points by the French Administrative Supreme Court ( Conseil d'État ) at the time of the litigation brought against the bailiffs' map (Decision 417958 of 21 August 2019). By applying this method to updated data, particularly concerning turnover and staffing in the two professions, and by reasoning from the situation where, on the expiry date of the first map, all the appointments provided for by the decrees of 28 December 2017 would be effective (which is a protective approach for the professionals since, in reality, this will not be the case), the Autorité estimates that the potential is between 450 and 500 new bailiffs in private practice and between 25 and 30 new judicial auctioneers in private practice by 2026 . To achieve this objective, and in light of the relevant information collected during the investigation, it proposes to create additional offices for the free establishment of 100 new bailiffs spread across 32 establishment areas and 3 new judicial auctioneers spread across 3 establishment areas (out of a total of 99 areas) over the period of validity of the next map (2020-2022) in proportion to the locally identified needs. The remainder of the recommendations not met during the previous period (2018-2020) must be added to the newly created offices.  Consequently, the Autorité proposes the following two revised maps:  [1] Article L. 462-4-1 of the French Code of Commercial Law (Code de commerce) and Article 52 of the Macron Law. [2] The areas concerned cover all the départements of Mainland France, except those of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle. It also includes the départements of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, La Réunion and Mayotte as well as the French overseas collectivities of Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. [3] In areas “where locating offices appears useful to improve proximity or the supply of services”, applications for establishment that meet the conditions laid down are likely to be accepted within the limit of the recommended rate of creation. [4] In areas where no need for creation has been identified, the Minister of Justice may refuse an application for appointment to a new office only if it is likely to “undermine the continuity of operations of existing offices and compromise the quality of service rendered”. The ministerial refusal shall state the reasons on which it is based. It comes after a public opinion by the Autorité de la concurrence. [5] For 50% of bailiff offices, this rate exceeds 33% whereas it exceeded 36% in the previous period. [6] For 50% of judicial auctioneer offices, this rate exceeds 32% whereas it exceeded 36% in the previous period. III-The Autorité's qualitative recommendations In line with the wishes of the Legislator, the Autorité is also making a series of recommendations to the government to ensure the success of the reform that are intended to: provide for a transitional regime between two maps to ensure that any remaining appointments are made, even if the previous map has expired. It would thus be possible to carry over the appointments goal set for the period 2018-2020 to the second map. improve the appointments procedure in the orange areas by ensuring, for example that the decisions of the French Minister of Justice relating to applications to create offices in these areas are published on the website of the French Ministry of Justice. improve the appointments procedure in the green areas , for example by limiting the candidacies to a reduced number of areas (three, for example) within 24 hours of opening the application submission period. It is also proposed that: candidates be able to express an order of preference for their various applications; an electronic draw be held simultaneously in all areas; and improvements be made to the transmission of personal data to candidates relating to the status of the assessment of candidacies and changes to their ranking. Lastly, the maximum period of time between the appointment and the oath-taking could be increased and a period between the oath-taking and the obligation to start practising could be officially established (for example: six months). For bailiffs, the Autorité also recommends clarifying, through national guidelines, the respective roles of those responsible for organising the oath-taking of professionals appointed at local level. lower barriers to admission for candidates seeking establishment . The rules relating to personalised solicitation could be clarified in order to avoid any divergent interpretations, and made more flexible so that newly appointed professionals are actually in a position to become known and expand their client base.  For judicial auctioneers and the future commissioners of justice, the “residency monopoly” could also be terminated. improve the map-making system by optimising the procedures for collecting the economic data needed to develop the recommendations for creating offices, as well as by improving the quality of the data transmitted by the authorities and by establishing a compulsory tool for monitoring the activity of the sub-offices for a more precise analysis of the activity of the offices. It is also recommended that the Autorité be involved in the development of the report mentioned in VII of Article 52 of the Law of 6 August 2015 on the appropriateness of expanding free establishment to the départements of the Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle. improve access to the offices for women and young professionals by extending the rules established in Ordinance 2015‑949 of 31 July 2015 relating to equal access for men and women to professional bodies and improve the work-life balance of judicial auctioneers (“ locum tenens ” system for maternity or paternity leave) to include bailiffs and judicial auctioneers, which are soon to be merged into the profession of commissioner of justice.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background The Autorité has been informed of anti-competitive practices in the meal vouchers sector by the company Octoplus (Resto Flash), which offers a mobile application for the payment of meals, as well as by several professional trade unions - the SNRTC ( Syndicat National de la Restauration Thématique ), the SNRPO ( Syndicat National de la Restauration Publique Organisée ) and the CPIH ( Confédération des Professionnels Indépendants de l'Hôtellerie ) -. After investigation, the Autorité fines of nearly 415 million euros the four historical issuers of meal vouchers in France: Edenred France, Up, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France as well as the Centrale de Règlement des Titres (CRT), which ensures, on their behalf, the processing and reimbursement of meal vouchers with their customers, considering that these players have disregarded competition law by implementing anticompetitive practices. Two types of practices were implemented: between 2010 and 2015, Edenred France, Up, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France exchanged confidential commercial information every month, through the CRT, regarding their respective market shares, which made it possible to restrict competition between them; between 2002 and 2018, Edenred France, Up, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France adopted a series of agreements intended to lock the market for meal vouchers by controlling the entry of new players and by reciprocally banning the launch of dematerialised vouchers issuing (in the form of a card or mobile application). These practices have harmed competition and slowed down the development in France of technological innovation, with dematerialised meal vouchers.  Meal vouchers, a tool that benefits 4 million employees The meal voucher is a form of payment allowing employees of companies and administrations who benefit from it to pay the price of a meal or certain food products that can be used in the composition of a meal, such as fruit and vegetables or frozen foods. In practice, specialised companies (\"issuers\"), like Edenred France, Up, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France, issue and sell meal vouchers to employers, for the payment of a sum corresponding to the face value of meal vouchers . The companies then give these titles to their employees at a lower price. The merchants then receive the vouchers in payment for the meal or the products. They then present these vouchers to issuers for reimbursement. These meal vouchers are distributed by 140,000 companies and benefit 4 million employees, who can use them in 180,000 shops (restaurants and local shops). A highly concentrated sector The meal vouchers sector has a high level of concentration: four operators (Edenred France, UP, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France) hold almost 100% of the meal vouchers market (paper and dematerialised vouchers combined). The sector also has the particularity of bringing these four operators together in a common structure, the Centrale de Règlement des Titres (CRT), which pools, for the latter, the processing of vouchers and their reimbursement to merchants. Other players only issue dematerialised vouchers, such as Moneo Payment Solutions (Moneo Resto), Caisse Fédérale du Crédit Mutuel (Monetico Resto) or Octoplus (Resto flash) . Their combined market share does not exceed 1.5% . The companies and brands affected by the decision are as follows: The four issuers exchanged confidential commercial information through the CRT, which led to a reduction of their commercial autonomy It appears from the facts of the case that the CRT has transmitted since 2010 to the administrative and financial directors of its member-policyholders (Edenred France, Up, Natixis Intertitres and Sodexo Pass France) monthly “dashboards” which retrace the market shares of each of its member-policyholders. These dashboards notably recorded the number of meal vouchers processed by the CRT in the previous month, disaggregated at the issuer level, as well as the monthly market share of each issuer, calculated from the number of vouchers processed. Given the characteristics of the market, and notably the high concentration of the meal vouchers sector, its transparency, the monthly frequency of exchanges, the level of disaggregation of the data exchanged, their confidentiality, these data were of strategic use for issuers. Thanks to this information, each issuer was able to detect any change in the pricing strategy of its competitors and therefore to dissuade it from adopting any aggressive pricing behaviour.  The four issuers have also adopted a series of agreements aimed at locking the meal voucher market. Adopting non-objective and non-transparent CRT membership conditions The CRT has been a major player in the sector for decades. Membership to the CRT allows its member-policyholders to benefit from economies of scale in terms of processing costs, to simplify management for merchants, by reducing the number of contacts, and above all, given its single point of contact, providing access to all merchants. To become a member-policyholder, the CRT articles of association provide that you must “ be presented by a member of the Association ” and “ be approved by the Board of Directors ”, the latter having the power to “ rule on the 'admission or exclusion of Members” . The admission decision \" does not have to be reasoned \" and an entry fee is \" possible \". This lack of transparency on the access conditions gives full freedom to the historical member-policyholders to select the competitors wishing to join the CRT, with the risk of arbitrariness and discrimination that this may involve. The Autorité considered that the membership conditions for joining the CRT were non-objective and non-transparent. The evidence in the file (meal vouchers dematerialisation project presentation document) attest the CRT's desire to maintain the competitive structure of the market, by preserving the positions of the four players, and to control the entry of new players: this document thus referred to the fact of \" controlling new entrants by developing a new medium \", and \" not facilitating the entry of new players \". The prohibition for historical issuers to launch into the dematerialisation of meal vouchers outside the CRT Under a \"Protocol\" signed by the four historical issuers in 2002, the member-policyholders of the CRT undertook \" to have the CRT carry out the processing with a view to reimbursing all of their meal vouchers (…), all these titles being materialised or dematerialised ”. This exclusivity clause was supplemented by a provision according to which the issuers who are members of the CRT refrain from developing, outside the CRT, an electronic payment platform making it possible to manage the processing of dematerialised vouchers. In the event of a breach by a member-policyholder of the reciprocal exclusivity clause, sanction measures were provided for: \" 10% of its provisional annual share of the expenses of the CRT \". In the event of persistence, a measure of exclusion from the CRT could even be pronounced on the grounds of the articles of association. The \"Protocol\" thus made it possible to give each issuer the guarantee that none of its competitors would participate in the development of a system for accepting dematerialised vouchers outside the CRT.  Practices which, together, concerned the entire meal voucher sector The practices fined by the Autorité began in 2002, when Natixis Intertitres joined the CRT, and only a few months after the adoption of a sanction decision by the Autorité against the three other historical issuers and the CRT. Accor (Titres Restaurant now Edenred), Sodexho Chèques et Cartes de services (now Sodexo Pass France), Chèque-déjeuner (now Up) and the CRT were fined ( see decision 01-D-41 ), notably, for sharing the meal voucher market and have uniformly set the commission rate requested from restaurant owners. 18 years later, the Autorité fines again these operators, as well as Natixis Intertitres, for anticompetitive practices that affected the entire meal voucher sector. The exchange of information enabled each of the four issuers to be informed of the commercial strategy of its competitors, thereby reducing their commercial autonomy and disrupting the proper functioning of competition in this market. In addition, by dissuading any competitor from entering the market, the historical issuers have granted themselves the exclusive use of the substantial advantages generated by the CRT. Finally, by mutually forbidding themselves to launch unilaterally into the issue of dematerialised vouchers, and while several of them had already taken the plunge abroad, the member-policyholders limited themselves in their capacity to innovate on the market and to offer a different format of meal vouchers to French consumers. In a marked background, at the conclusion of the \"Protocol\", by discussions with the public authorities on the adaptation of the legal framework in favour of the dematerialisation of meal vouchers, the member-policyholders have, in doing so, made them without purpose any future development of applicable legislation, by refraining from independently offering dematerialised solutions to their customers. In doing so, the practices have contributed to deny businesses and employees the benefits of digital innovation. In light of these elements, the Autorité hands out fines to the four historical issuers as well as the CRT. In fixing the amount of the sanctions, it took into account as an aggravating circumstance the reiteration of the 2001 sanction decision, and increased the sanctions accordingly in regard to the CRT and the three historical issuers. The Autorité has thus increased by 20% the fine corresponding to the exchange of information and by 30% that relating to market locking practices in regard to issuers. 1 Now  Union des Métiers et des Industries de l'Hôtellerie. Additional compensation, which takes the form of a commission, is most often requested by the issuer. 3 In 2016. 4 In market share of the face value issued, all media combined. 2016 figures.  > See the full text text of decision 19-D-25 of 17 December 2019  Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background The Autorité publishes today a decision by which it fines a national cartel between the main fruit-compote manufacturers, which lasted from October 2010 to January 2014. More specifically, the agreement concerned: ● products sold to food retailers under retailers' own-brand labels ● products sold to food service distributors (“out-of-home catering”). The companies fined are: Materne, Andros, Conserves France, Délis/Vergers de Châteaubourg, Charles Faraud/Charles & Alice, as well as Valade. Coroos, which also participated in the infringement, reported the agreement as part of the leniency procedure. This approach led the Autorité to conduct an in-depth investigation. The Coroos company was able, in exchange for its cooperation during the investigation, to benefit from a full exemption from fines. The fined companies represented, throughout the infringement period, almost the entire market for compotes sold under retailers' own-brand label (90%) and out-of-home catering (100%). The compotes market The main outlet for compote producers is the supermarket distribution channel. Some of the products are sold under so-called \"premium\" or national brands (for example the Materne, Pom'Potes, Andros, St-Mamet, Charles & Alice brands). Another part of the products is sold under retailers' own brand label, i.e. the brands developed by the food retailer brands, whose products are manufactured by the companies of the sector. In practice, mass retail brands usually organise tenders to select suppliers who will manufacture their compote-based products and on which they will then affix their own brands. The second distribution channel for the production of compotes is that of sales to distributors specializing in “out-of-home catering”, such as Sodexo, Compass, Pomona, Pro A Pro or Transgourmet. These distributors also generally obtain supplies from manufacturers through tenders and then supply actors of the catering service (company canteens, etc.), hotels/restaurants, hospitals and other accommodation facility (schools, retirement homes, etc.).  At the origin of the case: a request for leniency presented by Coroos in 2014 and dawn raids carried out in September 2015 The cartel was brought to the Autorité de la concurrence in early 2014 by the companies from the Dutch group Coroos, which applied for leniency. This procedure enables companies which took part in a cartel to reveal its existence to the Autorité and to benefit, under specific conditions, from a total or partial exemption of fine, depending on the order in which they refered the case to the Autorité. ( to learn more about the leniency procedure, click here (in French) ). On this basis, the companies from the group benefited from a total fine exemption, in regards to their cooperation throughout the investigation.  The dawn raids carried out in September 2015 by the Investigation services of the Autorité de la concurrence in France and in the Netherlands with the cooperation of the Dutch competition authority (ACM) ( see the press release ) led to finding extensive evidence, which completed the evidence broight by the leniency applicant. Operating as a network enables a better efficiency in the implementation of competition law The European Competition Network (ECN) is an integrated and reinforced cooperation network between national competition authorities from the European Union and the European Commission. Within the network, competition authorities can for instance seek the support of their counterparts to carry joint dawn raids and cooperate on cases (see Article 22 paragraph 1 of the Regulation 1/2003). Fined practices In 2010, Materne, Andros, Conserves France, Délis SA, SAS Vergers de Châteaubourg, Charles Faraud, Charles & Alice, Valade and Coroos Conserven BV decided to implement a comprehensive plan aimed at: Raising the selling prices of compotes to retailers' own-brands and out-of-home catering clients and to coordinate on the amount of the price increase. Agreeing on a common discourse justifying these price increases Sharing the volumes and clients Market players justified the implementation of the cartel by an adverse economic situation, due to the increase of the cost of raw material and packaging, and by the increasing pressure exerted by buyers (mass retail and food service distributors), in the framework of call for tenders or as part of OTC trades. The behaviour of Coroos, a Dutch manufacturer which initially aimed for an agressive pricing policy, would also have been perceived by the historical market players as a threat to their respective positions. Investigation established that the companies at stake multipled multi- and bilateral contacts during meetings, encounters, mail exchanges and calls. The operation of the cartel was secret and quite sophisticated: some actors used dedicated cellphones, used specifically for the cartel, or exchanged via dedicated email boxes. Most of the meetings were held not in professional premises but rather in hotels and restaurants in Paris and in mainland France , such as Concorde Opéra, the Novotel from the Gare de Lyon, Parisian restaurant Visconti, the Starbucks at St Lazare, the Novotel of Lyon Gerland or the one in Lille. By way of illustration, among the evidence in the case, a presentation document can be found. Seized at Materne, it acted as a discussion point during a plenary meeting from the cartel on 5 October 2010. This PowerPoint, named « P&L » (« Profit & Loss »), presents the goals of the participants from 2010 and 2011 in terms of price and profitability. It draws up the list of call for tenders – ongoing or future-, with the projections for the market share distribution. It points out the markets with « negative or low profitability» which require, according to the cartel participants, a price increase. It is stated that it should « cover all the cost price increases of the products and to enhance the profitability of all the market ».  The implementation of commun goals involved the distribution of call for tenders organized by the mass retail as well as the ones from food service distributors (“out-of-home catering”). Participants to the cartel also planned compensations to correct the potential volume gains or losses affecting one manufacturer or another, if they were not going the way it was previously planned. For example, during the meeting of 3 September 2013, compensations and distribution of tonnage and markets were discussed, Andros had for instance to « give volume back » to others (as far as it had earned more than planned in 2010).) and St-Mamet « looking for 1500 tonnes ».  Very serious infringements Horizontal agreements (i.e.; between direct competitors on a same market), consist in secretly agreeing on prices and volums, represent, by their very nature, the most serious infringements of competition law. In this case, the cartel, which involved the main manufacturers of compotes sold to food retailers under retailers' own-brand labels and to food service distributors (“out-of-home catering”), was of national scale and involved consumer goods (fruit mash in cups and pouches). The cartel covered a very important part of the market (90 % on average for retailers' own-brand labels and 100 % for food service distributors ), which deprived the call for tenders organizers of the possibility to introduce competition and get the best prices . Competitors aimed at removing incertainty – on the competitors' behaviours, price evolution- which caracterize a fully competitive market. The Autorité, after examining all the facts of the case, evaulated that fines for a total amount of 58 283 000 euros should be imposed to the companies at stake. Coroos, considering its cooperation in the leniency procedure, was exempted from any financial penalty. The Autorité found aggravating circumstances against Materne, taking into consideration the fact that the the company played a very active role in organizing the cartel. Thus, for instance, Materne : Acted as a intermediary between all participants. During a bilateral meeting with Coroos in September 2012, Materne gave an order of magnitude of price increase by indicating that it would send new prices on 1 October 2012, with an increase of 15 to 18 centimes per kg and that Andros would raise its price by 15 % ; in July 2013, Materne sent an email to Coroos with the prices that Andros had send to it ;  \t Drafted the « P&L  November 2010 » and « P&L 2 » documents, which served as supports for the first three multilateral meetinfs during which the parties determined their extensive plan; \t Booked the rooms for all multilateral meetings retraced during the investigation. In order to guarantee that the sanctions were set a dissuasive level, the Autorité also increased the fine against Délis and Vergers de Châteaubourg (owned by Lactalis), Andros (owned by Andros et Cie) and Conserves France (owned by Conserve Italia Societa Cooperativa Agricola), taking into consideration that the four companies were owned by groups with a strong economic power and important ressources. Finally, under mitigating circumstances, it reduced the fine imposed to Andros, noting that the company, « perturbed » the functioning of the cartel by acting as a « maverick » (meaning that it still caried an aggressive commercial policy to win market share).  What's the leniency procedure? The leniency procedure enables companies which are participating or participated in a cartel to reveal its existence to the Autorité et to benefit, under certain circumstances, from a partial or total exemption of the fine, depending on the order in which they refered the case to the Autorité, on the added value of the evidence brought forward and their cooperation during the investigation. Most of the cartels were dismantled by the Autorité through the leniency procedure.  19-D-24 of 17 December 2019 Read the decision Video : Entente dans le secteur des compotes Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

The transaction had been carried out without being subject to mandatory clearance by the Autorité , as the notification thresholds were not exceeded.  The Autorité considered that such a merger could not constitute an abuse of a dominant position. The referral In November 2017, Towercast lodged a complaint with the Autorité de la concurrence concerning the abusive nature of TDF's takeover of Itas. It contested TDF's acquisition of Itas, one of its last competitors in the terrestrial broadcasting market, in so far as it aggravated TDF's dominant position in the market. TDF's acquisition of Itas was completed in October 2016, without prior clearance, as the French and European notification thresholds, which are based on turnover, were not exceeded. It had therefore not been examined by the French and European competition authorities in the context of merger control. Towercast's complaint considered that the transaction nevertheless constituted, in itself, an abuse of a dominant position by TDF and that TDF, which enjoys dominance in the upstream and downstream wholesale markets for digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting, hampered competition due to a significant strengthening its position. The argument was, inter alia , based on a judgment of the Court of Justice of 21 February 1973 in the case of Continental Can Company . The principle laid down by the 1973 ruling of the Court of Justice on Continental Can At a time when there was no European mechanism subjecting company mergers to compulsory prior control, the European Commission (1) considered, on the basis of Article 86 of the EEC Treaty (now Article 102 of the TFEU), that Continental Can had abused its dominant position by acquiring one of its competitors, thereby virtually eliminating competition in a substantial part of the European market concerned.  The Court of Justice (2) then confirmed the possibility of applying Article 86 of the EEC Treaty (now Article 102 TFEU) to merger transactions, holding that “Abuse may therefore occur if an undertaking in a dominant position strengthens such position in such a way that the degree of dominance reached substantially fetters competition, i.e. that only undertakings remain in the market whose behaviour depends on the dominant one.” However, it had annulled the European Commission's decision in this case on the grounds that the decision had not, “as a matter of law, sufficiently shown the facts and the assessments on which it is based”. A system of compulsory and prior control of European mergers was introduced following the Continental Can judgment The Autorité notes that, following the Continental Can judgment, a system of compulsory prior control of mergers was introduced at the European level by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989, and subsequently amended by Regulation No 139/2004, currently in force. This European merger control system allows national competition authorities to refer transactions to the European Commission, under the conditions set out in Article 22 of Regulation 139/2004, even when they are “below the [national] thresholds” for mandatory notification, so that they can be examined by the Commission. It should be noted that this possibility was not used in the case of the transaction in litigation. When Regulation No 4064/89 was adopted, the Council and the Commission considered “for pressing reasons of legal security, that this new Regulation will apply solely and exclusively to concentrations (...)”. Currently, Regulation No 139/2004 specifies in its Article 21(1) that Regulations implementing Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are not applicable to concentrations as defined in its Article 3. (3) The adoption of this European merger control system therefore leads to the non-application of Article 102 of the TFEU to a concentration such as the contested one. In domestic law, it is clear from the case law and decision-making practice of the Conseil de la concurrence , and subsequently of the Autorité, that the procedures applicable to concentrations on the one hand, and to the suppression of anticompetitive practices on the other, are also incompatible and irreconcilable with each other. The Autorité cannot therefore, on the basis of Article L. 420-2 of the French Code of Commercial Law ( Code de commerce ), consider that a concentration, even if it does not reach the national thresholds set in Article L. 430-2 of the Code de commerce requiring compulsory notification, constitutes in itself an abuse of a dominant position. Given the scope of the applicable provisions, the transaction cannot, in itself, constitute an abuse of a dominant position under Articles 102 of the TFEU and L. 420-2 of the Code de commerce . Moreover, Article L. 430-9 of the Code de commerce cannot be applied, as no conduct detachable from the merger itself has been demonstrated. As the reported practices were not established, the Autorité therefore considered that the procedure should not be pursued.

The Autorité also announces the launching of an exploratory investigation into the business telecoms market.  The Autorité de la concurrence received a request for interim measures, ancillary to a complaint on the merits of the case, from the Association des Opérateurs Télécoms Alternatifs (AOTA). AOTA represents more than 40 alternative regional telecom operators with aggregate and rapidly growing revenues of more than €200 million. The practice alleged by AOTA: denial of access to an essential facility In its complaint, AOTA argued that, despite numerous requests from its members, Orange was improperly denying some of its members activated access to its fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) infrastructure. The FTTP infrastructure includes active fibre and elements deployed in Orange's civil engineering network. The civil engineering network of Orange is an infrastructure to which all operators have access under identical conditions. Orange's denial to certain of AOTA's members would have prevented them from providing sufficiently attractive offers to businesses and public authorities. Based on the information provided by AOTA in its complaint, it is not currently possible to characterise Orange's fibre network as an essential facility The Autorité, which requested the opinion from ARCEP ( France's Electronic Communications, Postal and Print media distribution Regulatory Authority) , considered that - given the existence of various alternatives - access to Orange's nationwide activated FTTP offer does not appear to be strictly necessary (or indispensable) to compete in the relevant market. However, this strict necessity criterion must be fulfilled so that the notion of essential facility can be applied. Besides, on the basis of the deployment of several alternative optical fibre networks or those shared with Orange, it can be concluded that it is possible to duplicate Orange's FTTP infrastructure. The Autorité notes that the FFTP networks, among which Orange's, are still being deployed by several operators and that describing a network that is not completely deployed yet as an essential facility seems premature. Thus, and without it being necessary to analyse the other conditions laid down by case law to date, these conditions being cumulative and strictly interpreted, Orange's FTTP infrastructure cannot, given the information available to the Autorité , be considered as an essential facility. The Board of the Autorité therefore took the decision to reject the complaint on the merits for lack of evidence and, consequently, the request for interim measures ancillary to the complaint on the merits of the case. Initiation of an exploratory investigation However, during the examination of this case, the Investigation Services were able to identify potential concerns which justify that the Autorité opens an exploratory investigation into the business telecommunications market. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that there are no practices that distort competition in the business market, whose growth remains fragile. Upon completion of this exploratory investigation and depending on the evidence gathered, the Investigation Services may open a litigation case if conditions warrant.

        "full_text_press_realease": "It requires Google to negotiate with publishers and news agencies the remuneration due to them under the law regarding related rights for the re-use of their protected contents. Background Following a complaint lodged in November 2019 by several unions representing press publishers (Syndicat des éditeurs de la presse magazine, l'Alliance de la presse d'information générale) and Agence France-Presse (AFP) of practices implemented by Google on the occasion of the entry into force of the law of 24 July 2019 on related rights, the Autorité de la concurrence today orders interim measures in the context of the urgent interim measures procedure . The Autorité found that Google's practices on the occasion of the entry into force of the related rights law were likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position, and caused serious and immediate harm to the press sector. It thus requires Google, within three months, to conduct negotiations in good faith with publishers and news agencies on the remuneration for the re-use of their protected contents. This negotiation must retroactively covers the fees due as of the entry into force of the law on 24 October 2019. Google's practices contested by news publishers and the AFP  According to the complainants, the methods of implementation by Google of the law of 24 July 2019 aiming at creating a related right for the benefit of news agencies and press publishers would constitute an abuse of a dominant position, as well as an abuse of economic dependence. The law of 24 July 2019 transposes into French law the directive on copyright and related rights of 17 April 2019, and aims to set the conditions for a balanced negotiation between publishers, news agencies and digital platforms, in order to redefine, in favour of press publishers and news agencies, the sharing of the value between these actors. However, on the grounds of complying with the law, Google unilaterally decided that it would no longer display article extracts, photographs, infographics and videos within its various services (Google Search, Google News and Discover [1] ), unless the publishers grant them the authorisation to use them free of charge. In practice, the vast majority of press publishers have granted Google licenses to use and display their protected content, without possible negotiation and without receiving any remuneration from Google. In addition, as part of Google's new display policy, the licenses it has been granted by publishers and news agencies offer it the possibility of taking up more content than before. Under these conditions, in addition to their complaint on the merits of the case, the complainants requested interim measures aimed at enjoining Google to engage in negotiations in good faith for the remuneration of the re-use of their content.  The Autorité believes that Google may have abused its dominant position in the market for general search services by imposing unfair trading conditions on publishers and news agencies. The Autorité has led, upon receiving the referrals, an investigation to rule on the interim measures, and heard, not only Google, press publishers and the AFP, but also several economic players (other search engines for example) or institutional actors. The board of the Autorité held a session on 5 March 2020 to hear the complainants and Google. The decision issued today is intended to protect the complainant businesses from the consequences of potentially abusive practices, pending the decision on the merits of the case, which will be preceded by an investigation allowing the Autorité to rule on the existence of competition law breaches. At this stage of the investigation, the Autorité considered that Google is likely to hold a dominant position on the French market for general search services. Indeed, its market share is around 90% at the end of 2019. In addition, there are strong barriers to entry and expansion on this market, linked to significant investments necessary to develop a search engine technology, and to the effects of networks and experience such as to make Google's position even more difficult to contest by competitive engines wishing to develop. In the current state of the investigation, the Autorité considers that the practices denounced by the complainants are likely to be qualified as abuse of dominant position on several grounds: \t Imposing unfair trading conditions \t At this stage of the investigation, Google may have imposed on publishers and news agencies unfair transaction conditions which would have allowed it to avoid any form of negotiation and remuneration for the re-use and display of protected content under related rights. \t Circumvention of the law \t Google used the legal option to grant free licenses for certain content in certain cases, deciding that generally no remuneration would be paid for the display of any protected content. The Autorité notes that, in the state of the investigation, this choice seems difficult to reconcile with the purpose and scope of the law, which aimed to redefine the sharing of value in favour of press publishers vis-à-vis platforms, by assigning a related right which must give rise to remuneration, according to precise criteria. Furthermore, Google refused to provide publishers with the information necessary to determine the remuneration and considered that it could reproduce all the titles of the articles in their entirety, without seeking the publishers' agreement. • Discrimination By imposing a principle of zero remuneration on all publishers without examining their respective situations, and the corresponding protected content, according to the precise criteria laid down by the law on related rights, Google may have treated in the same way, economic actors with different situations outside of any objective justification, and therefore of having implemented a discriminatory practice. These different practices are likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position from Google. Google's practices caused a serious and immediate harm to the press sector, while the economic situation of publishers and news agencies is otherwise fragile, and while the law aimed on the contrary at improving the conditions of remuneration they derive from content produced by journalists. These practices are made possible by the dominant position that Google is likely to hold in the market of general search services. This position leads Google to bring significant traffic to the websites of publishers and news agencies. Thus, according to the data provided by the complainants relating to 32 press titles, and not disputed by Google, the search engines - and therefore Google for a large part - represent, according to the sites, between 26% and 90% of the redirected traffic to their pages. This traffic is also very important and crucial for publishers and news agencies who cannot afford to lose any share of their digital readership due to their economic difficulties. Under these conditions, publishers and news agencies are placed in a situation where they have no other choice than to comply with Google's display policy without financial counterpart. Indeed, the threat of downgrading from the display is synonymous for each press publisher with the loss of traffic and therefore of income, both if it is the only one affected by this downgrading and if this downgrading targets all the publishers. This is the reason why most publishers have been led to accept conditions which are even more unfavourable for them after the entry into force of the law on related rights than those pre-existing. Given all of these elements, the Autorité notes the existence of a serious and immediate effect on the press sector, resulting from the behaviour of Google, which, in a context of major crisis in the sector, deprives publishers and news agencies of a resource considered by the legislator as vital for the sustainability of their activities, and this at the crucial moment of the entry into force of the law. As a result, the Autorité issued several injunctions as a matter of urgency. Interim measures pronounced The objective of the interim measures pronounced is to allow publishers and news agencies wishing it, to engage in negotiations in good faith with Google in order to discuss both the terms of the re-use and display of their content that the remuneration associated to it. During the negotiation period, Google will have to maintain the display of text extracts, photographs and videos according to the methods chosen by the publisher or the news agency concerned. In addition, in order to guarantee a balanced negotiation, the interim measures provide for a principle of neutrality on the way in which are indexed, classified and more generally presented the protected contents of the editors and agencies concerned with the services of Google. Finally, these interim measures will remain in force until the adoption by the Autorité of its decision on the merits. During this period, and in order to ensure the effective implementation of these interim measures, Google will have to send the Autorité monthly reports on the procedures for implementing the decision. Injunctions made to Google in the context of emergency measures Google will have to negotiate in good faith with the publishers and news agencies that request it, and according to transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria, the remuneration due to them for any re-use of protected content. This negotiation must also cover, retroactively, the period starting from the entry into force of the law on related rights, that is, on 24 October 2019. This injunction requires that the negotiations effectively result in a proposal for remuneration from Google. -> Google must conduct negotiations within 3 months from the request to open negotiations from a press publisher or a news agency -> Neither the indexing, nor the classification, nor the presentation of the protected content taken up by Google on its services should in particular be affected by the negotiations. -> Google will have to provide the Autorité with monthly reports on how it is complying with the decision. These injunctions will remain in force until the publication of the decision on the merits of the Autorité. [1] Google Discover is accessible on tablets and smartphones.

Complaint The Minister of the Economy and Ki ala lodged a complaint with the Autorité de la concurrence regarding practices targeting La Poste in 2010. They notably denounced a partnership agreement concluded between La Poste and Mondial Relay and loyalty rebates practices.  The interim measure's decision taken by the Autorité in 2011 La Poste planned to conclude a partnership with its competitor Mondial Relay, which would have enabled it to present to online sales sites a delivery offer at pick-up points combining its own network of post offices and merchants with that of Mondial Relay. Given its important position on the market and following the investigation initiated by the Autorité, La Poste had suspended its partnership with Mondial Relay. In a decision 11-MC-01 ( see press release ), the Autorité noted the contract suspension and decided to pursue the investigation into the merits of the case. The Autorité delivers today its investigation into the merits of the case.  Competition concerns identified by the Autorité: La Poste's rebate system The latter were offered by La Poste, depending on the customers and the years, several types of rebates, in particular retroactive, which according to the customers, the type of delivery (home or out of home) and the years, were calculated from: either home parcel delivery flows only, a segment in which La Poste is an essential partner (more than 80% market share); or the cumulation of home and out-of-home delivery flows. Such rebates could encourage customers to entrust their out-of-home and home deliveries to La Poste without competitors being able to compete with these discounts, given that a large number of customers are forced to contact La Poste for a certain part of their home parcel delivery. Commitments In response to these competition concerns, La Poste notably proposed to: put an end to any price coupling between his home and out-of-home package deliveries by fixing separately the rebates associated with each of these types of delivery; remove, for home parcel deliveries, the loyalty effects resulting from rebates and which are likely to harm the development of competition. The Autorité made these commitments mandatory and closed the case opened before it, as it responds to competition concerns - La Poste's competitors are able to compete with La Poste.  In accordance with article 8 of ordinance n° 2020-306 of 25 March 2020 and as indicated by the Autorité's press release of 27 March 2020 regarding the adaptation of the time limits and procedures of the Autorité de la concurrence during the health emergency period, the decision will be enforceable at the end of a period of one month from the end of the state of health emergency.

The application makes it possible for users to access linear television services free of charge, as well as additional functionalities (search, recording, downloading, catch-up TV, replaying programmes from the beginning, etc.), some of which are billed to the user. Molotov's complaint According to Molotov, TF1 and M6 suddenly and abusively broke the distribution agreements for their channels on its platform. The behaviour may be linked to the concomitant launch of Salto, the subscription TV and video-on-demand platform created by TF1, M6 and France Télévisions. The behaviour of TF1 and M6 would constitute “exclusionary abuse of the Molotov platform” (abuse of collective dominant position) and an abuse of a situation of economic dependency, and would also attest to the “existence of anticompetitive collusion” between TF1 and M6. Assessment by the Autorité The Autorité, which examined the various elements of the case and sought the opinion of the CSA, considered that neither the complaint nor the investigation file provides evidence of the alleged practices. Accordingly, there is no evidence of the existence of a dominant position held collectively by France Télévisions, TF1 and M6. Moreover, there is no evidence of the existence of a situation of economic dependency in which Molotov would find itself with either M6 or TF1. Lastly, there is no evidence of the existence of an explicit or tacit agreement between TF1 and M6 having the intention or effect of restricting competition by excluding Molotov from the market.  In light of these details, the Autorité dismissed Molotov's complaint and consequently the related request for interim measures.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité de la concurrence has imposed fines worth a total of €444 million on three pharmaceutical companies, Novartis, Roche and Genentech, for abusive practices designed to sustain the sales of Lucentis for AMD treatment to the detriment of Avastin (a competitive medicinal product that is 30 times cheaper). The Autorité de la concurrence 's Decision 20-D-11 of September 9 2020, which sanctioned Novartis Pharma SAS, Novartis Groupe France SA, Novartis AG, Roche SAS, Genentech, Inc. and Roche Holding AG, was annulled by a decision of the Paris Court of Appeal dated February 16 2023, which ruled that no anti-competitive practice had been established against these companies. This decision may be subject to an appeal to the French Court of Cassation. Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of low vision for people over 50 in industrialized countries. It causes severe impairment of central vision, which is particularly present in the form of dark spots perceived by the patient in the middle of its vision. The Genentech laboratory has developed a drug, Lucentis, to treat AMD. It also developed another medicine, an anti-cancer drug, Avastin. Doctors realised that Avastin had positive effects for patients with AMD, which led to a development of its use, without marketing authorisation (MA), to treat this disease, while Avastin costed 30 times cheaper than Lucentis. Following the development of the off-label use of Avastin in the treatment of AMD, public authorities in many countries have initiated research projects aimed at testing the efficacy and possible side effects associated with the prescription of Avastin for AMD treatment. It is in this context that the Genentech, Novartis and Roche laboratories have implemented a set of behaviours (abuse of collective dominant position) aimed at preserving the position and the price of Lucentis, by curbing the off-label use of the anticancer drug Avastin. Abuse of a collective dominant position An abuse of a collective dominant position is a concept of competition law which apprehends a dominant position, not from the position of a single actor but from the market power of companies having close ties with each other. The Autorité considered that the three laboratories - Novartis, Roche and Genentech – have to be examined as forming a “single collective entity” within the meaning of competition law, as regards to cross-holdings and contractual ties between them, including licensing agreements between Genentech and Novartis, on the one hand, for marketing Lucentis, and between Genentech and Roche, on the other hand, for marketing Avastin. Given the differences in the cost of treatment using the two medicinal products , the use of Avastin rather than Lucentis would entail a significant loss of income for each of the three laboratories:  first, for Novartis, which, as the licensee, earns income from sales of Lucentis on the market in question, for Genentech, which, as the licensor, earns licensing revenue on sales of Lucentis on the market in question, and for Roche, which, as the major shareholder and, since March 2009, sole shareholder in Genentech, earns dividends on the profits made by this US laboratory. Novartis disparaged Avastin Novartis sought ways in which to discredit the decisions taken by some ophthalmologists who, exercising their freedom to prescribe, prescribed Avastin off-label to treat patients in Ophthalmology. It has been fined for disparaging practice, including unjustifiably exaggerating the risks associated with the 'off-label' use of Avastin, designed as a cancer treatment, to treat AMD, and, more generally, its use in Ophthalmology, compared to the safe and well-tolerated use of Lucentis for the same purposes. This conduct had the effect of reducing the number of off-label prescriptions of Avastin to treat AMD and, more generally, other uses in Ophthalmology. This also had the indirect effect of maintaining Lucentis at supra-competitive price levels and particularly high, and led to fixing the price of Eylea (another competitor medicinal product launched on the market in November 2013) at an artificially high price. An alarmist and misleading discourse before the public authorities Novartis, Roche and Genentech have also been sanctioned for colluding in obstructive behaviour and spreading an alarmist and sometimes for having misleading discourse, before the public authorities, regarding the risks related to the use of Avastin to treat of AMD. These practices aimed at obstructing or unduly slowing down initiatives taken by the public authorities to authorise the off-label use of Avastin to treat AMD. The practices sanctioned are particularly serious as they have been undertaken in the healthcare sector, in which competition is limited and, more specifically, at a time of public debate over the impact on social security finances of the extremely high price of Lucentis - a drug that is fully reimbursed by the French Social Security system - while there has been a significantly cheaper medicinal product, Avastin, that can be used in Ophthalmology.  In total, the Autorité issued a sanction of 444 million euros, which breaks down as follows: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and its treatment A matter of public health and finances AMD, disease of the retina caused by macular degeneration, central part of the retina, is the main cause of visual impairment in patients of 50 years old and more in industrialised countries. Late AMD severely affects central vision, mainly presenting as dark spots in the centre of the patient's field of vision. AMD has been the subject of a great many scientific studies, in light of the fact that it has major implications for public health and healthcare funding, since the treatments available are particularly expensive. Treatments The therapy with medicines belonging to the class of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) was originally developed by US pharmaceutical laboratory Genentech to treat certain types of cancer, by inhibiting the vascular progression of cancerous tumours. Anti-VEGF medications have also been used to treat certain eye diseases involving excessive vascularisation in the eye, as in AMD, by means of intravitreal injections. As a result of its research on VEGF inhibition, Genentech developed two medicinal products: bevacizumab (sold under the brand name Avastin) and ranibizumab , sold under the brand name Lucentis: Avastin Genentech markets Avastin in the United States. In the rest of the world, Genentech granted Roche a licence to develop and market Avastin. Avastin has been marketed in France by Roche since 2005, under a Community marketing authorisation [1] granted in January 2005, to treat certain types of cancer. Lucentis  Genentech markets Lucentis in the United States. In the rest of the world, Genentech granted Novartis a licence to develop and market Lucentis. Lucentis has been marketed in France by Novartis since 2007 for the treatment of AMD [2] , following the issuance of a European Marketing Authorisation issued in 2007. Its indication for use was later extended, in 2011, for the treatment of other eye diseases. When it was launched, in 2007, Lucentis cost €1,161 per injected dose. The price subsequently dropped several times, between 2008 and 2013, to the current price of €789.50 per dose. In a document on outpatient healthcare expenditure in 2012, the French healthcare insurance fund specified that Lucentis had become the most expensive medicinal product used in outpatient healthcare in terms of reimbursements by the French Social Security system, with a total of nearly €390 million reimbursed to patients, and a high growth rate of around 30% compared to the year before. The off-label use of Avastin by ophthalmologists Following the early days of its use in Oncology, some doctors observed that patients diagnosed with both a malignant tumour and AMD also saw an improvement in their AMD when administered Avastin for the cancer. The use of Avastin to treat AMD (and other eye diseases) then became more widespread in France and worldwide (Europe, United States of America), even after Lucentis had been authorised for reimbursement. Since Avastin is a hospital-only medicine, it was mainly administered in a hospital setting. When a doctor prescribes Avastin in Ophthalmology, a single vial of Avastin can be used to administer several injected doses, bringing the unit cost per injection to around €30/40, compare to a Lucentis injection cost of €1161. For information, in 2010, a whole vial of Avastin cost €348.10 excluding VAT.  Roche never intended to apply for a marketing authorisation to use Avastin in Ophthalmology, so its use has been off-label, within principle of freedom of prescription framework granted to all doctors. Initiatives launched by public authorities to ensure the safe use of Avastin In response to the continuing off-label use of Avastin, the public authorities in many countries decided to launch various research programmes to test the effectiveness and the existence of any adverse effects linked to prescribing Avastin for the treatment of AMD. This research included the CATT study (USA), carried out in 2011 and 2012, and IVAN study (UK), carried out in 2012 and 2013.. In France, discussions on the off-label use of Avastin began in 2006, leading to the launch, in 2008, of the GEFAL trial, funded by the French Ministry for Health and the French National Health Insurance Fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie ). The GEFAL trial, the results of which were published in May 2013, concluded that Avastin and Lucentis are equally effective and no differences in the safety profile of each could be identified. Pending the results of these different trials, the French authorities, including the ANSM [3] in particular, adopted a position of prudence, acknowledging the existence of the usage of Avastin without marketing authorisation for AMD treatment, while urging caution on the part of the ophthalmologists. Nonetheless, in December 2011, the situation changed with the passing of the Bertrand [4] law, which introduced stricter controls on off-label prescription, followed by the adoption in July 2012, by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS), of a directive prohibiting the repackaging of Avastin for ocular injection.  At around the same time, the French legislator initiated studies on tightening control of off-label prescriptions, setting out a new legal framework. This process eventually led to the adoption, in 2014, of a procedure enabling the issue of a Temporary Recommendation for Use (RTU), when the prescribing clinician deems the use of said medicinal product essential for improving or stabilising the patient's clinical status even if there is an alternative appropriate treatment that is approved under a marketing authorisation (French Social Security Finance law No. 2014-892 of 8 August 2014, amended, and the decree on its implementation dated 30 December 2014). This new regulatory framework made it possible to provide a framework for this use, by overcoming the circumstance that a laboratory does not wish to apply for a MA for a drug that is nevertheless used by doctors to treat a condition. This was the case with Roche for Avastin, which has consistently refused to seek Marketing Authorisation for use in ophthalmology. Avastin was the subject of an RTU taken by ANSM for use in the treatment of AMD in June 2015. Three closely tied actors dominated the AMD market : The collective dominant position of Novartis, Roche and Genentech The three companies Genentech, Roche and Novartis are tied by significant close structural and strategic links. First, Genentech is connected to Roche and Novartis through licensing agreements for marketing Avastin and Lucentis, respectively, outside the United States. The agreements linking Genentech and Novartis, on the one hand, and Roche, on the other hand, provide for a highly-organised system of feedback, discussion forums and joint management committees. Second, Genentech, Roche and Novartis have particularly significant cross-holdings: Roche was the majority shareholder in Genentech up until 2009 and, since then has become the sole shareholder in the American pharmaceutical company. Novartis is one of the major shareholders in Roche, with a 33.33% share of the voting rights in Roche Holding.   [1] All medicinal products industrially manufactured and sold on a domestic market or within the European Union must have been granted a marketing authorisation. Issuing a marketing authorisation permits the marketing of a medicinal product as indicated for one or more treatment(s), following assessment by the medical authorities of the risk/benefits of its use, based on scientific studies. [2] Community marketing authorisation obtained on 22 January 2007. [3] Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament - the French national agency for safety of medicines and health products [4] Law No. 2011-2012 of 29 December 2011, on tightening the requirements regarding the safety of medicinal and health products Thanks to these structural ties and cross-holdings, Genentech, Roche and Novartis have been able to implement a common strategy in the market. The three companies have strong financial incentives for keeping Avastin and Lucentis separate. Given the differences in the price of the two medicinal products, and the practice entailing making up a number of syringes using a single vial of Avastin, the use of Avastin rather than Lucentis for ocular injection was liable to entail a significant loss of revenue for each of the three companies. And the development of Avastin as an alternative to Lucentis was a \"measure\" to keep the price of Lucentis very high. Also, the structural ties created by the licensing agreements between them has meant that it was possible for them to be aware of their partners' respective behaviour, and, as a result, ensure that they were all following the same line of action. Bearing in mind Roche's holdings in Genentech, the commercial and development policies of the two companies are very closely linked, with Genentech depending on Roche to set out its general strategy. In such a situation, Roche had no interest in pursuing a policy that would position Avastin on the market in such a way that it would be detrimental to the interests of its own subsidiary, Genentech. Together, they form a united entity that enjoyed a dominant position regarding treatment for AMD, which came to an end in 2013 with the arrival of Eylea (Bayer) on the market, which won a 36% share of the market within only 3 months of its market launch in November 2013.   Anticompetitive practices Objection 1: The disparaging of Avastin by Novartis (duration: March 2008 to November 2013) Novartis led a global, well-organized communication campaign that tended to discredit the use of Avastin to treat eye disease, in favour of Lucentis. This campaign targeted ophthalmologists and, in particular, Key Opinion Leaders, doctors recognised in their field who might relay the message put out by the pharmaceutical company. Novartis also spread this message among patient associations and the general public . The evidence in this case shows unequivocally that the message put out by Novartis was not based on any concern for public health, but was an anticompetitive tactic designed to knowingly stoke fears regarding whether or not it was safe to use Avastin 'off-label' in the field of Ophthalmology, in order to preserve the strong position of Lucentis and its high price. Novartis was not content to simply discuss the objective differences between Lucentis and Avastin, nor to faithfully present the scientific context relating to the use of Avastin. Instead, it disseminated data comparing Avastin and Lucentis, mainly drawing on a selective and biased presentation of the available scientific data, with a view to playing up the risks related to the off-label use of Avastin to treat AMD and other eye diseases: First, Novartis spread a discourse suggesting, and occasionally stating outright, that there was an increased risk of systemic reactions related to the biological properties of Avastin, which are not the same as those of Lucentis, while playing up the supposedly greater safety of using Lucentis. Second, Novartis proceeded with a selective and biased presentation of the results of scientific trials comparing the effectiveness and safety profiles of Avastin and Lucentis for use in the field of Ophthalmology. By focusing on certain results out of context, and highlighting the methodological shortcomings of trials while abstaining from presenting their general conclusions, Novartis' presentation of the results available from scientific studies was fragmented and given out of context. Third, Novartis was also selective in its presentation of changes made by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Avastin and that for Lucentis. Novartis' discourse regarding these changes suggested that the EMA had decided to make it public that systemic adverse effects had been detected only in the case of Avastin, whereas the EMA had concluded that no distinction could be drawn between the different anti-VEGF therapies, to which Lucentis also belongs. Novartis also only posted any information about the changes to the SmPC for Avastin (which, in any case, is not the product marketed by Novartis), moreover by neglecting to mention that the same changes had also been made to the SmPC for Lucentis. Last, Novartis claimed that healthcare professionals who prescribed Avastin 'off-label' risked being held liable under civil and criminal law.  This communication campaign had a real and significant impact on the behaviour of healthcare professionals and, consequently, on the structure of the market. It reduced off-label use of Avastin at many hospitals for the treatment of AMD and, more generally, in Ophthalmology. Furthermore, by reducing the frequency with which Avastin was prescribed and, thereby, maintaining Novartis in a quasi-monopolistic position, Novartis' discourse had the effect of preventing Avastin from being used in comparative trials organised by the authorities in charge of setting the price of medicinal products and thus to support any reduction in the price of Lucentis. Thus, these practices had a mechanical effect on the pricing of Eylea, alternative to Lucentis, meaning it was priced at more or less the same list price as Lucentis (10% less).   Objection 2: Practices implemented by the three companies with regard to the public authorities  (duration: Roche: April 2008 to the beginning of November 2013 – Novartis: May 2011 to the beginning of November 2013 – Genentech: April 2011 to the beginning of November 2013) Novartis and Roche, aided by Genentech, initiated a series of blocking tactics, and their discourse with regard to the French public authorities was alarmist and misleading. These practices were designed to exacerbate their concerns and block any initiatives undertaken by the public authorities to set up procedures for the safe use of Avastin in the treatment of AMD. As of April 2008, Roche sought to delay the GEFAL trial ( Groupe d' Étude Français Avastin versus Lucentis - the French Evaluation Group Avastin Versus Lucentis) by refusing for several months to supply the samples and data required to go ahead with the trial, which had been requested by the ANSM (National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) and developing an alarmist discourse regarding the safety profile of Avastin for ocular injection. In all its subsequent communications with the ANSM, Roche continued to mislead the Agency, through a biased presentation of the results of trials that were then beginning to be published. As of May 2011, Novartis also disseminated a worrying discourse before the public authorities, selecting certain results of comparative studies and presenting them out of context. This discourse was communicated to all the stakeholders in the healthcare sector, stirring up a great many reactions. As soon as the public authorities made it known that they were considering issuing an RTU for Avastin, Roche and Novartis stepped up their initiatives and contacts with government and health authority representatives. The message at this time included a biased presentation of the process that had resulted in a change to the SmPC for Avastin and highlighted the risks of causing a new health scandal.  Evidence in this case also reveals that, from April 2011, Genentech was systematically involved in the communications between Roche and the health authorities and informed the content of the message to be communicated.   Roche and Novartis acted to delay the GEFAL trial and influenced the health authorities, amplifying their concerns and influencing them to maintain a position of extreme prudence even following publication of the first favourable results of trials comparing Avastin and Lucentis (i.e. updates from AFSSAP, the French Agency for the Medical Safety of Health Products in 2009 and 2011, and a recommendation by the HAS, the French National Authority for Health in 2012).  The discourse also had a direct influence on the decision by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) to prohibit the off-label use of Avastin, in July 2012, and, more generally, in delaying the adoption of provisions designed to control and ensure safety with regard to the off-label use of Avastin in the field of Ophthalmology.  In so doing, the three companies ensured that Avastin could not be recognised by the French health authorities as an appropriate comparator in trials alongside Lucentis, which would have enabled the authorities in charge of pricing medicinal products to renegotiate the price of Lucentis to bring it down substantially at a much earlier date.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Following a report sent by the French Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), the Autorité handed out fines totalling €642,800 firstly to the Centre Vinicole Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte, and then to importers Financière Martin and Distillerie Dillon for having respectively granted and benefited from exclusive import rights for Nicolas Feuillatte and Palmes d'Or champagne on the islands of Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthélémy and in Martinique, after 22 March 2013, end date of the period granted to companies to comply with the provisions of the Lurel law. The Lurel Law has prohibited exclusive import agreements since March 2013 The Law of 20 November 2012 on Economic Regulation in French overseas territories, known as the Lurel Law, has prohibited agreements or concerted practices having as their objective or effect to grant exclusive import rights that are not justified in overseas territories since 22 March 2013. The companies contractually or de facto maintained exclusive import practices after March 2013 In this case, the Centre Vinicole Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte and the company Financière Martin continued to stipulate exclusive import rights in their distribution agreement for the islands of Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthélémy until 1 January 2015. The exclusive distribution contract for Martinique between the Centre Vinicole Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte and Distillerie Dillon, lasted until 2015. The exclusive import practices nevertheless were extended until the end of June 2016, with the concerned companies agreeing to uphold them in practice. Nicolas Feuillatte, in agreement with Distillerie Dillon, has refused to sell to distributors in Martinique that did not work with the company Distillerie Dillon and has set up a system allowing to identify and thereby to limit imports of Nicolas Feuillatte champagne from competing wholesale-importers. Penalties issued These practices, which continued for several months, even years, after 22 March 2013, hindered the development of competing wholesale-importers and prevented retailers from benefiting from competition between wholesalers for their supplies of Nicolas Feuillatte and Palmes d'Or champagne. Despite the fact that the counter-bargaining power of mass-market retailers is significant, that there are many competing brands and frequent special offers, overseas consumers, whose purchasing power is lower than those in mainland France, have still suffered the consequences of these sanctioned behaviours.

        "full_text_press_realease": "In its decision of 22 August 2019, the Autorité polynésienne de la concurrence ruled that the Wane Group had breached the Polynesian Code of Competition Law ( code de la concurrence polynésien ) by engaging in abuse of its dominant position in the beverage distribution sector. Using the avenues for appeal provided for by Polynesian Law, the Wane Group lodged an appeal on the merits against that decision before the Paris Court of Appeal. The case was passed on to the Autorité Prior to that decision being adopted, the Wane Group submitted to the First Presiding Judge of the Paris Court of Appeal a request for the case to be transferred for reasons of legitimate suspicion of bias regarding the President of the Autorité polynésienne de le concurrence . Following a judgment of the French Supreme Court ( Cour de cassation ) annulling the ordinance declaring that appeal inadmissible, the First Presiding Judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ruled again the request for legitimate suspicion admissible, and, properly grounded, appointed the Autorité de la concurrence to rule on the infringement proceedings that resulted in the disputed decision. Following this ordinance, the Autorité polynésienne de la concurrence passed on the case files regarding Wane group to the Autorité de la concurrence . Under the applicable provisions, the Autorité does not have the competence for ruling on practices in French Polynesia For its part, the Autorité de la concurrence considers that the facts submitted to it for examination do not come within its subject matter competence. The Autorité de la concurrence is competent, under the powers entrusted to it by the legislator, to rule on: - the application of French national and European competition law in the territory of Metropolitan France (i.e. the Home Country of France), in French overseas départements , and in the French “overseas collectivities” (overseas local authorities) of Saint‑Barthélemy and Saint-Martin; and - the application of French national competition law only, in the “overseas collectivities” of Saint‑Pierre et Miquelon and Wallis et Futuna. Therefore, the competence of the Autorité does not cover French Polynesia. In this oversea territory, control of anticompetitive practices lies by virtue of the provisions of a “law of the country” (“ loi du pays ”) adopted through the procedures provided for by Article 74  of the Constitution and the organic law establishing the status of French Polynesia under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Autorité polynésienne de la concurrence  (which was created in 2015 by the country's law n° 2015-2 of February 23, 2015 ). The Autorité de la concurrence has consequently, declined its competence to rule on the file transmitted by the Autorité polynésienne de la concurrence.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background On 23 October 2020, the Autorité received a referral from several associations representing various players of the online advertising sector (media, internet networks, advertising agencies, technical intermediaries, publishers, mobile marketing agencies), and contesting practices implemented by Apple on the occasion of upcoming changes to its iOS 14 operating system. More specifically, the issue was the mandatory introduction of the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework for applications on iOS that would like to monitor the user activity on third party websites. Activity tracking, based in particular on the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Apple's own identifier, enables targeted advertising, which is the source of funding for a large number of applications or websites. The Autorité de la concurrence examined whether the measures implemented by Apple to offer users a reinforced framework of consent for the use of their personal data could be regarded as necessary and proportionate to the objective pursued. It also received an opinion from the CNIL (National Commission on Informatics and Liberty) on the issues raised. In the state of the investigation, the Autorité considered that the decision of Apple to set up a feature for collecting complementary consent to that implemented by other players in online advertising, did not appear as an abusive practice, when (1) a company, even if it is in a dominant position or can be considered as a structuring platform, has the freedom in principle to set rules to access its services, subject to not disregarding the laws and applicable regulations and that these rules are not anti-competitive; (2) the applicable regulations (GDPR and ePrivacy) do not preclude the implementation of such an obligation, while the wording adopted does not appear to induce an unfavourable bias to the monitoring procedures on third-party sites, such as imposing an unnecessary obligation or lacking proportionality, and that such a measure can facilitate, for users, the control of the use which is made of their personal data. The Autorité therefore rejects the request for interim measures. However, it continues the investigation into the merits of the case. This should in particular make it possible to verify that the implementation by Apple of the ATT framework cannot be regarded as a form of discrimination or \"self-preferencing\", which could in particular be the case if Apple applied without justification, more binding rules on third-party operators than those it applies to itself for similar operations. Apple announced in June 2020 that it would implement a user consent collection system to strengthen the protection of its users' personal data. At the 22 June 2020 conference for application developers, Apple announced that, as part of its policy to strengthen the privacy protection of its customers, it would implement, in September 2020 [1] , a feature called ATT for App Tracking Transparency. This feature consists, when the holder of an iPhone visits an application downloaded via the App Store, in displaying a pop-up window which then asks for their explicit consent to authorise the sharing of their personal data to third parties for advertising purposes. With consent, third parties can access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which identifies each Apple device and enables tracking of the owner's advertising, including on third-party sites. According to the complainants, by imposing compliance with the ATT feature on iOS applications, Apple would be abusing its dominant position Complainant associations criticise Apple for requiring application developers to use ATT framework in order to gain access to the IDFA identifier. The consent collection via the ATT framework would condition the user's advertising tracking on third-party sites, which then allows to address them targeted advertising. In doing so, Apple allegedly imposed unfair trading conditions on application developers, which would characterise an abuse of a dominant position (prohibited by Article 102 (a) of the TFEU). They consider, on the one hand, that the ATT request is redundant and superfluous, because the obligation to obtain consent already weighs on application developers under the provisions of GDPR (EU) 2016/679 and under the e-Privacy directive. On the other hand, they consider that Apple is imposing undue additional obligations on application developers in doing so, again constituting a violation of Article 102 (d). They therefore request the Autorité to issue urgent interim measures: order Apple not to require, as it is, the use of ATT to obtain user authorisation for its advertising tracking ; order Apple to engage in a constructive dialogue with industry players in order to find an acceptable solution to obtain user authorisation for their advertising tracking.  The facts of the case do not appear likely, in the light of the elements submitted during the proceedings, to constitute an abuse of a dominant position. When the Autorité receives a request for interim measures, these can only be issued when the denounced practices are likely to breach competition law and in the event of serious and immediate harm to the overall economy, to the industry, to the interests of consumers or to the complaining company. To determine whether the request for interim measures was justified, the Autorité conducted an extensive investigation under urgent procedure, hearing numerous professionals representing the various online advertising professions. The debates, during the hearing of 10 February 2021, enabled each of the stakeholders to assert their position and enrich the information gathered during the investigation. The Autorité received an opinion from the CNIL on the various issues regarding the enforcement of the legislation relating to the privacy protection raised by the case. After analysing the information provided by the complainants, the Autorité considers, in the context of a preliminary investigation under urgent interim measures, that the introduction of the ATT framework does not appear to reflect an abuse of a dominant position on the part of Apple, leading to imposing unfair trading conditions. ATT solicitation is part of Apple's privacy policy and does not appear to be unnecessary, lacking of objectivity and of proportionality In particular, the Autorité noted that the introduction of the ATT framework  was part of Apple's long-standing strategy to protect the privacy of users of iOS products. It then noted that such an initiative fell within the framework of the margin of appreciation available to any company to determine its technical or commercial strategy, vis-à-vis its commercial partners or to lay down usage rules, including whether this company holds a dominant position or can be regarded as a structuring platform. In this case, the establishment of a mandatory formalised framework, according to the format and wording defined by Apple, can help to keep users properly informed. The Autorité noted in this regard that the obligation to collect the ATT framework  was not immediately implemented by Apple (its effective date having been postponed to March-April 2021) and that it leaves certain possibilities of adaptation for application developers. In particular, they have control over the sentence defining, in the ATT window, the purpose of monitoring personal data carried out on third-party sites; they have the option of deferring the triggering of the ATT framework , by refraining during this period from using the IDFA, to monitor activity on third-party sites. Finally, they have the possibility to send two windows to the user, before and after the appearance of the ATT request, in order to explain the need for them to be able to carry out this activity monitoring (for example to be able to fund the application or the offered service), and to convince the user to reconsider a refusal of follow-up, for example. The existence of a differential process (\"self preferencing\") will be examined further in the context of the investigation into the merits of the case As regards, more specifically, to the differential process between the collection of the user's consent for Apple's advertising services and that of third-party advertising services noted by the complainants, the Autorité considered that this did not result in this stage, that Apple would apply, by imposing the ATT framework  on actors wishing to access the IDFA, a more rigorous process than that which it would apply to itself for similar process. The investigation into the merits of the case will however make it possible to ensure that this process does not constitute an anticompetitive practice, in particular in that it would reflect a form of discrimination or \"self-preferencing\" on Apple's part. In light of these elements, the Autorité rejected the request for urgent interim measures but decided to continue investigating into the merits of the case.

Background The Autorité de la concurrence has imposed a joint financial penalty of €435,000 on Santerne Nord Tertiaire (hereinafter Santerne) and several companies of the Vinci Group for engaging in concerted practices in order to distort competition, which is prohibited by Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). The decision follows an investigation carried out by the DGCCRF (French Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control) in the building operations management sector and a transaction refusal on the part of Santerne, which led to the referral to the Autorité [1] . Santerne participated in the exchange of information with another tendering company, Neu, in order to be awarded a public contract for the maintenance and transformation of building management systems for the city of Lille (Lille Métropole Communauté Urbaine). These exchanges took place prior to the submission of tenders and concerned important aspects of the contract (prices for the most important equipment and materials and the contents of the technical proposal). The submission of two separate and seemingly independent bids misled the contracting authority as to the degree of competition between the two tenderers. These exchanges altered effective competition and violated Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code du commerce ), which prohibits anticompetitive agreements.  [1]  Since 2008, the Minister of the Economy has injunction and transaction powers to regulate local anticompetitive practices. Therefore, for anticompetitive practices affecting local contracts committed by companies with a turnover of less than €50 million individually, and €200 million all together if several companies are involved in the practices, the Ministry has the authority to put an end to them and impose fines of up to €150,000 per company (up to 5% of their turnover).  Context In 2017, the DGCCRF carried out an investigation in the building management systems sector for the city of Lille ( Lille métropole communauté urbaine , hereinafter LMCU). It found that companies had engaged in practices involving the exchange of confidential information for two calls for tenders which took place in 2013 and 2014 respectively. As Santerne Nord Tertiaire (subsidiary of Vinci) was the only company to refuse the transaction proposed by the DGCCRF, the DGCCRF submitted the case concerning the company to the Autorité de la concurrence , in accordance with Article L. 464-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). The call for tenders organised by the city of Lille ( Communauté Urbaine de Lille ) in 2014 for building management systems In building operations management, building management systems (BMS) are used for monitoring (electrical equipment, lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, hot water, sanitation, alarms, access control, lifts, etc.), supervision to ensure the comfort of the building's occupants by optimising operating costs (measurements, metering, adjustment and equipment programming) and follow-up (energy efficiency measurement, assessment, options for improvement, etc.). In 2014, LMCU organised a call for tenders for the maintenance and transformation of its building management systems. On the tender submission deadline, three companies had submitted bids: Neu, Santerne Tertiaire et Santé, and Eiffage Energie Tertiaire Nord. At the end of the tendering process, the contract was awarded to Neu. Anticompetitive practices The investigation revealed the existence of telephone calls and email exchanges between Santerne and Neu before the tender submission deadline. Neu, in particular, provided Santerne with information regarding the prices it planned to propose (unit prices/price list) as well as part of its technical plans (technical proposal). This information concerned the most important aspects of the contract. Santerne alleges that the exchanges in question only concerned subcontracting services planned with Neu and that subcontracting was required for it to submit its bid in the call for tenders. However, according to settled case law, the submission of two separate and seemingly independent bids inevitably misleads the contracting authority as to the degree of competition between the tenderers, even though the practice in question would have only had a limited impact on the choice of the successful bidder. Such exchanges, which alter effective competition, are prohibited by Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code du commerce ). The fine imposed on Santerne reflects the seriousness of the practice in which it engaged and the damage which it caused to the economy. In order to ensure the deterrent nature of the fine, account was also taken of the fact that the company is owned by the Vinci Group, which has very substantial resources (70% increase) and the recurrent situation [2] in which companies of the Vinci Group find themselves (15% increase). As for Neu, it was previously fined under the transaction it signed with the French Ministry of the Economy.  [2]  Vinci was previously fined for participating in horizontal agreements under Decision 06-D-07 of 21 March 2006 regarding practices implemented in the public works sector in the Île-de-France region.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Following an investigation by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) into the tobacconist security provision sector, mainly in the Pays de la Loire and Nouvelle Aquitaine regions, Leray Sécurité accepted the settlement proposed by the DGCCRF, whereas Double Tour, which had also issued cover quotes, rejected it. The DGCCRF therefore referred the case relating to this company to the Autorité de la concurrence in accordance with Article L. 464-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). Provision of security to tobacconists In order to protect their shops from criminal acts, tobacconists regularly employ specialist security companies. They can apply for government aid for this, which covers part of the cost of the work. To obtain this aid, known as \"tobacconist security aid\", it was necessary at the time of the practices to submit two quotes from competing companies to the public authorities. Issuing of cover quotes The investigation established that, between 2011 and 2017, Leray Sécurité and Double Tour regularly exchanged information, particularly by email, concerning the prices and nature of the services tendered to obtain the security work, before submitting their bids. More specifically, in the case of the quotes concerned by the investigation, when one of the two companies wanted to be chosen to provide security for tobacconist, it would first send a price bid to that tobacconist. It would then ask its competitor to submit a higher bid than its own (known as a \"cover quote\"). Leray Sécurité and Double Tour exchanged cover quotes on 82 occasions. Leray Sécurité and Double Tour thus took turns to artificially undercut one another in their quotes, enabling them to win the contracts concerned at the desired price. A practice that distorted competition and contributed to the misuse of public funds By using cover quotes to skew the competition process required by regulations, Double Tour breached competition law and contributed to the misuse of public funds. In view of these factors, and taking into account the scale of the practices but also the low value of the quotes concerned, the Autorité handed out a fine of 9,100 euros to Double Tour.  Coordination of powers between the DGCCRF and the Autorité de la concurrence concerning local practices Since 2008, the Minister of the Economy has had the power to issue injunctions and reach settlements in the case of local anticompetitive practices. For anticompetitive practices affecting local markets, by companies with turnover of less than 50 million euros individually (or 200 million euros collectively if more than one company is involved), the Minister is therefore able to propose a settlement which cannot exceed 150,000 euros per company (up to a limit of 5% of their turnover). If a company rejects a settlement or fails to comply with injunctions, the Minister refers the case to the Autorité de la concurrence .

Karafun group produces and distributes karaoke videos and owns two karaoke establishments in Lille and Brussels. In recent years, establishments such as those operated by Singing Studio or Karafun, have been offering karaoke activity in private rooms. In Singing Studio's establishments, songs in French represent over half of the videos played and a customer sings at least five songs in French during one session. The most requested titles include the repertoires of Michel Sardou (notably \" Les lacs du Connemara\"), Francis Cabrel, Michel Berger, Aya Nakamura and Stromae. Karafun is a major player in the sector, especially for songs in French language. Singing Studio criticised Karafun for brutally changing its terms of sale in July 2019, by refusing to sell it single videos as it had done until then, and offering a subscription at a rate considered abusive and discriminatory. Singing Studio also maintained that Karafun group refused to provide it with certain karaoke songs, the most requested by customers, by reserving them for its own establishments, the “Karafun Bar”. By doing so, Karafun would have wanted to put Singing Studio in a difficult situation, or even to eliminate it from the market, in order to get customers back to the Karafun Bar. Along with its referral into the merits of the case, Singing Studio had requested urgent interim measures. The Autorité considered that the referral was lacking evidence The Autorité noted that Karafun could hold a dominant position in a market for the design of karaoke song videos in French. However, it found that by refusing, from July 2019, to continue to sell single videos to Singing Studio, Karafun only terminated agreements that violated its general terms of sale. The subscription offer made to Singing Studio is, moreover, in line with the commercial policy practiced with regard to all karaoke professionals. Regarding the subscription price, there is nothing in the case to demonstrate that the price charged with regard to Singing Studio is a discriminatory or abusive price. Furthermore, there is nothing in the case to establish that the subscription sales and the technical characteristics of those subscriptions were implemented to \"lock\" the market or putting competing karaoke establishments in a difficult situation. Finally, Singing Studio's allegations that Karafun reserves the most requested titles for itself are groundless. The case shows that the video catalog is the same for all customers and that Karafun does not reserve any titles for its own establishments. In view of these elements, the Autorité rejected Singing Studio's referral and subsequently the request for urgent interim measures.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Amid the amplification of the phenomenon of cinema screen congestion , due in particular to the periods of reduced access or closure of said rooms, in 2020 and 2021, related to the Covid-19 health crisis, the Autorité issues an opinion on a consultation project for distributors on a film release schedule when cinemas reopen in 2021. The Autorité is fully aware of the inadequacy of the current mechanisms to deal with the amplification of the phenomenon of screen congestion and is also keen to inform companies about the compatibility with competition law of cooperative behaviour considered to respond to the crisis. Also, although there is no precise draft agreement to date, the Autorité has endeavoured to provide stakeholders with a general analysis grid accompanied by elements of assessment, in order to enlighten them on how the future agreement might meet the requirements for obtaining an individual exemption. In the current state of the law, the Autorité considers that a temporary agreement of this type is likely to constitute an agreement prohibited by national and European competition law but that it could, on the other hand, in a litigation framework, benefit from an individual exemption, provided that a certain number of criteria are met. The Médiateur du cinéma's referral In February 2021, the Autorité was asked by the Médiateur du cinema (Cinema Mediator) to give an opinion on the possibility of consultation between film distributors aimed at temporarily setting up a regulated film release schedule, until a return to a normal situation. The Médiateur expressed, during the investigation, the wish that \" the opinion issued by the Autorité sets out the framework of what it is possible to do, at this stage \", in order to allow distributors to engage in negotiations. This referral follows a joint letter sent to the Médiateur in January 2021 by the l' Agence pour le développement régional du cinéma (hereinafter \"the ADRC\"), the Association française des cinémas d'art et d'essai (hereinafter “the AFCAE”) and the Bureau de liaison des organisations du cinéma (hereinafter “the BLOC”). The Covid-19 health crisis has deeply affected the film industry. While the congestion of cinema screens with a growing number of previously unreleased films is not a new phenomenon, it will increase, in unprecedented proportions, when cinemas reopen in 2021. Indeed, distributors will not only wish to release films whose release on screens, initially scheduled for 2020, was prevented, but also to rerun certain films already presented in cinemas in October 2020 and whose exploitation was interrupted due to the second closure of cinemas, especially those which won awards during the Césars 2021 Ceremony. In addition, they will also have to broadcast films scheduled for release in 2021. In mid-March 2021, the stock of films concerned was estimated at around 400, which would imply, according to the BLOC, a release rate of 50 to 60 films per week to issue within a reasonable time (for comparison , according to the Médiateur , “ since 2016, the average number of new films that are released each week is around 14 ”). The scope of the Autorité's opinion In a referral for an opinion, the Autorité can only rule on general competition issues and not on whether a practice infringes competition law. Nor can the Autorité , in the context of its advisory functions, rule on the possibility of granting a practice the benefit of an exemption. It cannot therefore implement a “ruling” type procedure, which would consist in issuing a formal position statement to secure initiatives or projects, upstream of their implementation. In addition, to these inherent limits in the framework of any referral for opinion to the Autorité , there are specific limits linked to the absence, to date, of a project or precise model of agreement under negotiation within the film industry. Thus, a certain number of essential parameters of this possible agreement, such as its parties, its content and its duration, are therefore still undetermined. Despite the constraints and limitations mentioned above, the Autorité intends to take into account the exceptional context resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. From the outset of the health crisis and in line with the common message sent by the European competition network to businesses in March 2020, it has always shown itself to be concerned with enlightening businesses on the compatibility of cooperative behaviours with competition law considered to respond to this crisis. It is also aware of the inadequacy of current mechanisms to cope with the amplification of the phenomenon of cinema screen congestion mentioned above. This is why it endeavoured to provide, as part of its opinion, a general analysis grid, accompanied by elements of assessment, on the conditions that could make a temporary consultation between film distributors on the release dates of the films in cinema in compliance with competition law.  The Autorité's analysis On the agreement As a preliminary point, it should be noted, on the one hand, that, subject to contrary legislative provisions, competition law applies to the cinematographic sector and, on the other hand, that the existence of a crisis cannot in itself exclude the anticompetitive nature of an agreement. At the end of the investigation and the hearing, it appears that among the various options considered, that of an agreement between distributors, limited in time, on a sufficiently upstream transparent and organised determination of a film release schedule seems to be one of the best suited options, at this stage, both to overcome the inadequacies of the current mechanisms and to form the subject of a certain consensus - to the exclusion, of course, of actors having specifically express their opposition to any form of consultation. The elements of assessment, presented by the Autorité below, will therefore be based on this sole assumption.  The envisaged consultation, in that it would bring together film distribution companies for the purpose of drawing up a film release schedule, reflects a competition of wills between legally distinct and economically independent companies, taking the form of an agreement, and could be classified as an agreement within the meaning of competition law. Insofar as the envisaged consultation project would be likely to relate to a large number of films, whether or not they are French, and in view of the very large number of films to be released in cinemas in France when they reopen in 2021, it is not excluded, moreover, that it could appreciably affect trade between Member States, which would make European competition law applicable in this case. Moreover, it is not excluded either that an agreement between film distributors relating to the date of film release in cinemas could be considered as involving a restriction of competition by object (sharing of the market over time) or by effect (removal of one of the parameters on which distributors compete and / or difficulty, for certain distributors not participating in the agreement, to broadcast their films).  On the possibility of obtaining an exemption The consultation project submitted for an opinion to the Autorité would be a horizontal type agreement which could not, by definition, benefit, in a litigation framework, from the provisions of exemption regulation No. 330/2010 relating to vertical agreements. Moreover, given its nature, it does not appear either to be able to benefit from the provisions of the exemption regulation relating to specialisation agreements or that relating to research and development agreements. On the other hand, in a litigation framework, the parties to the agreement could, under certain conditions, benefit from an individual exemption. In this regard, parties to the agreement should: First, demonstrate that the agreement would contribute to promote economic progress and therefore provide elements making it possible to verify this contribution, the link between the agreement and its impact on economic progress as well as the probability and the significance of that impact. In this regard, in its referral, the Médiateur argues that the agreement would aim to preserve the diversity of the film offer and the widest distribution of works in accordance with the general interest, in an exceptional period characterised both by the accumulation of an unprecedented stock of films and by probable sanitary restrictions when cinemas reopen. In addition, in a previous opinion issued in 2009 (09-A-50 of 8 October 2009), the Autorité noted that cultural objectives could be accepted as part of economic progress. In addition, are recognised as sources of qualitative economic progress, agreements allowing the improvement of production and distribution through better services or better quality. Secondly, demonstrate that the net effect of the agreement would be at least neutral from the cinema operators' point of view and that the agreement would not be detrimental to spectators, by giving them access to a diversified offer and to all types of films. Thirdly, establish in particular the insufficiency, given the exceptional nature of the current situation, of alternative options to consultation between distributors on a release schedule for films in cinemas, such as, for example, commitments programming or deviating from the media chronology by broadcasting the films directly to video-on-demand platforms or television channels. Finally, demonstrate that competition would be preserved for a substantial part of the film distribution activity, and that the players involved in this process would continue to compete on many parameters not included in the agreement. The distributors could, in this regard, endeavour to show that the concertation would be limited in time, would relate only to the release date of the films in cinemas and that, if necessary, competition between them could subsist on all the other parameters, such as the number of establishments in which the films would be broadcasted, the number of copies of the films, the screening times, the duration of the films' exposure as well as the commercial negotiations with the cinema operators concerning both the choice of films only on the economic parameters of the contracts. As soon as the parties to the agreement demonstrate that the conditions recalled above are met, the Autorité considers that an agreement between distributors on a time-limited schedule for the release of films when the cinemas reopen could, in this particular context, benefit from the individual exemption provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 101 TFEU and in 2 ° of I of Article L. 420-4 of the Commercial Code.

Google also proposed commitments, accepted by the Autorité, that will change the way its advertising service DFP and its sales platform AdX function.  Following referrals from News Corp Inc., Le Figaro group [1] and the Rossel La Voix group, the Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision sanctioning Google, up to 220 million euros, for having abused its dominant position in the advertising server market for website and mobile applications publishers. The Autorité noted that Google granted preferential treatment to its proprietary technologies offered under the Google Ad Manager brand, both with regard to the operation of the DFP ad server (which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space), and its SSP AdX sales platform (which organises the auction process allowing publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventories to advertisers) to the detriment of its competitors and publishers. The practices in question are particularly serious because they penalised Google's competitors in the SSP market and publishers of mobile sites and applications. Among these, the press groups - including those who were at the origin of the referral to the Autorité - were affected even though their economic model is also strongly weakened by the decline in sales of print subscriptions and the decline in associated advertising revenue. The Autorité recalls that a company in a dominant position is subject to a particular responsibility, that of not undermining, by conduct unrelated to competition on the merits, to an effective and undistorted competition. Google, which did not dispute the facts, wished to benefit from the settlement procedure. The Autorité granted its request. Google proposed commitments to improve the interoperability of Google Ad Manager services with third-party ad server and advertising space sales platform solutions and end provisions that favour Google. The Autorité accepted these commitments and makes them binding in its decision. Isabelle de Silva, President of the Autorité de la concurrence stated on the occasion of this decision: \"The decision sanctioning Google has a very special meaning because it is the first decision in the world to look into complex algorithmic auctions processes through which online display advertising works. The particularly rapid investigation revealed processes by which Google, building on its considerable dominance in ad servers for websites and applications, outperformed its competitors on both ad servers and SSP platforms. These very serious practices penalised competition in the emerging online advertising market, and allowed Google not only to maintain but also to increase its dominant position. This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all players, and the ability for publishers to make the most of their advertising space. \"  [1]  Le Figaro group withdrew its complaint on 6 November 2020.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background On 29 January 2021, Canal Plus Group (\"GCP\") referred practices allegedly implemented by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (\"LFP\") to the Autorité de la concurrence when the football Ligue 1's broadcasting rights were put back on the market in January 2021. It reproached the LFP, following the failure of Mediapro, of having committed an abuse of a dominant position by releasing on the market only the rights returned by Mediapro, without including rights corresponding to lot 3 (Saturdays 9 p.m. and Sundays 5 p.m. matches), awarded on 29 May 2018 to beIN Sports, which had subsequently sub-licensed it to GCP. That complaint on the merits of the case was accompanied by a request for interim measures. At the end of its investigation, the Autorité dismissed GCP's complaint on the merits of the case and the associated request for interim measures, considering that they were not supported by sufficient evidence. The call for tenders launched in 2018 by the LFP Broadcasting rights for the Football Ligue 1 are allocated by the LFP, which centralises their marketing on behalf of professional football clubs. Since 2008, these rights have been granted for four-year cycles, following calls for tenders. In April 2018, the LFP launched a call for tenders for the Ligue 1 's rights [1] , divided into several lots, for the seasons 2020-2021 to 2023-2024.  [1] The Ligue 2 rights were also included.     At the end of the call for tenders, the rights were allocated to the following operators: The failure of Mediapro and the broadcasting rights held by Mediapro put back on the market To exploit the rights it had been awarded, Mediapro launched the Telefoot channel on 17 August 2020. However it quickly encountered difficulties in honouring the rights payment deadlines to the LFP. After several months of negotiations, Mediapro and the LFP finally agreed on an early termination of the contract between them. This agreement was approved by the Nanterre Commercial Court on 22 December 2020. Following the restitution of the rights by Mediapro, the LFP organised in January 2021 a market consultation for the reawarding only of the rights previously awarded to Mediapro The consultation, launched on 19 January 2021, was declared unsuccessful as the LFP received offers (from Amazon, Discovery and DAZN) below the reserve prices. GCP's complaint At the same time as proceedings before the commercial court [1] , GCP lodged a complaint before the Autorité reproaching the LFP of having put back on the market only the rights returned by Mediapro, without including lot 3. In doing so, the LFP would have, on the one hand, imposed unfair trading conditions on GCP and, on the other hand, discriminated against GCP in relation to other buyers of Ligue 1 rights. GCP also requested the issuing of interim measures with a view to ordering the LFP to organise a new call for tenders, this time covering all the Ligue 1 rights (including lot 3) and suspend the execution of any contract resulting from the market consultation launched by the LFP. The agreement between GCP and the LFP In parallel with the proceedings initiated before the commercial court and the Autorité , GCP and the LFP concluded a comprehensive agreement, made public on 4 February 2021, concerning the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 broadcasting rights for the end of the 2020-2021 season.  The Autorité's analysis On unfair trading conditions The Autorité considered that the LFP's choice not to include lot 3 in the market consultation was both necessary and proportionate. On the one hand, indeed, it cannot be envisaged to require the LFP to terminate the contract concluded with beIN Sports on lot 3, this contract being duly formed, having never been contested in court and being perfectly executed. On the other hand, such a requirement would be all the less justified as the LFP's objective was to best protect its interests and those of the clubs following the failure of Mediapro, for which it cannot be held responsible. In a context further marked by the health crisis, which has degraded the income prospects of football clubs, the LFP had no interest, quite the contrary, in terminating the contract for lot 3. On the discrimination against GCP The Autorité noted that the terms of submission to the LFP market consultation appeared, as the case stood, both in line with the recommendations of the competition authorities, and identical for all potential candidates. Furthermore, the fact that GCP bears alone, given the sub-license agreement freely signed with beIN Sports, the financial burden associated with lot 3, is irrelevant for the analysis of a situation of discrimination. Indeed, the other potential candidates could also have already acquired rights relating to Ligue 1 or other sporting competitions and could themselves also be confronted, particularly with regard to new entrants, with the need to organise in a constrained time the distribution of their commercial offers and a schedule of programs. On the contrary, GCP could benefit from its presence in the market for the distribution of pay television services and its long-standing experience in the market for the acquisition of Ligue 1 rights.  The 2021 market consultation therefore does not appear to be discriminatory, since it treated all candidates in an equivalent situation in the same way.  In view of all of those elements, the Autorité rejected the complaint on the merits of the case from GCP and, consequently, the associated request for interim measures.  [1] GCP sued the LFP before the Paris Commercial Court, in order to obtain the cancellation of the consultation, on the grounds that it did not include lot 3, and asking it to order the LFP to organise a call for tenders for all Ligue 1 broadcasting rights for the seasons 2021-2022 to 2023-2024 (including lot 3). On 11 March 2021, the commercial court dismissed its request. Decision 21-D-12 of 11 June 2021 See full text of the decision Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Following a report sent by the French Minister of Economy (DGCCRF), the Autorité de la concurrence established that the Cattier company had disregarded the Lurel law by granting exclusive import rights for the distribution of its champagne in La Réunion. It fines the company 5,000 euros. The \"Lurel\" Law has prohibited all exclusive import agreements since March 2013 As of 22 March 2013, the law of 20 November 2012 on economic regulation in the French overseas territories, known as the \"Lurel\" Law, has prohibited concerted practices or agreements whose object or effect is the granting of exclusive import rights in the French overseas communities. This provision has been transposed into the French Commercial Code in Article L. 420-2-1. The exclusive import agreement set up by Cattier On 1 August 2013, an exclusive distribution agreement was concluded between Cattier and the importer-distributor Chrysyl (Le Vinarock). This distribution exclusivity covered the Cattier brand of champagnes and applied to the entire territory of La Reunion. This contract was renewed on 8 March 2016 and remained in force until Chrysyl was placed in judicial liquidation on 24 May 2017, more than three years after the Lurel Law came into force. A practice that harmed competing wholesalers and consumers The practice put in place hindered the development of competing importer-wholesalers in La Reunion and prevented retailers from increasing competition with wholesalers for their supplies of Cattier brand champagne. Consumers in La Reunion were thus unable to enjoy the prices they would have been entitled to expect from normal competition. In light of all these details, the Autorité imposed a €5,000 fine on Cattier. The Autorité did not investigate Chrysyl, which went into judicial liquidation on 24 May 2017.  Exclusive imports in overseas territories (Lurel law): practices that are the subject of specific attention by the Autorité This is the 9th decision by the Autorité de la concurrence concerning exclusive import practices in French overseas territories. The Autorité pays particular attention to respecting competition overseas, which is one of its priorities. 20-D-16 (champagne in the French Antilles and French Guiana)/ press release of 29 October 2020 ) 19-D-20 (perfumery and cosmetics)/ press release of 8 October 2019 19-D-11 (chemical pathology)/ press release of 29 May 2019 18-D-21 (consumer goods)/ press release of 8 October 2018 18-D-03 (termite traps)/ press release of 20 February 2018 17-D-14 (desserts)/ press release of 27 July 2017 16-D-15 (consumer goods)/ press release of 6 July 2016 15-D-14   (consumer goods)/ press release of 10 September 2015  As a reminder, in its opinion 19-A-12 of 4 July 2019 regarding the functioning of competition in overseas territories, the Autorité issued an overall diagnosis of the competitive situation in overseas territories and formulated around twenty recommendations aimed at strengthening competition overseas and acting on the structural causes of the high prices of consumer goods.

As Ambulances Sannac refused to settle, the DGCCRF forwarded the case file concerning it to the Autorité de la concurrence , pursuant to Article L. 464-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Hospital calls for tender for their medical transport In 2015, the Val d'Ariège (CHIVA) and Pays d'Olmes (CHPO) hospital centres issued calls for tender to renew their medical transport (ambulance transport) contracts. In response, the companies Ariège Ambulances, Cazal, Haute Ariège, Ollivier and Sannac, which had previously formed an economic interest group, joined Ensales, the outgoing contract holder. All the companies in a position to respond to these calls for tender therefore joined together to present a single tender. A group not technically and economically justified While groups are not illegal in themselves - they can allow a company to apply for a contract it could not execute on its own - the evidence in the case file shows that this group was oversized in relation to the size of the contracts concerned. In terms of both vehicles and personnel, it comprised resources that were totally disproportionate to those of the historical contract holders, even though there were no developments justifying the use of such resources. The low profitability of the services and the breakdown of the financial risks cannot justify the grouping together of all the companies likely to respond to the contracts. Moreover, no mutualisation was observed in the execution of the contracts, and CHIVA even improved the profitability of medical transport services in 2015. Practices implemented to the detriment of public hospitals It is clear from the statements of several consortium members that the primary purpose of its response was to eliminate the residual competition and agree on the prices offered to the hospitals. The creation of this group made it impossible for hospitals to request alternative proposals and increase competition, even though this is the very purpose of public procurement. This anticompetitive agreement completely foreclosed competition and, for some contracts, raised the prices paid by hospitals compared to the previous period. In light of all these details, the Autorité handed out a €32,600 fine on Sannac and its parent company Mafanel. Practices with a local dimension Since 2008, the Minister of the Economy has had the power to impose injunctions and settlements to resolve local anticompetitive practices. For anticompetitive practices affecting local markets and committed by companies whose turnover is lower than 50 million euros individually and 200 million euros for all companies combined if several are involved in the same practice, it therefore has the option to order companies to cease such practices and to impose a fine of up to €150,000 per company (up to a limit of 5% of their turnover).

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Following a complaint from Engie and the carrying out of dawn raids, the Autorité de la concurrence issues today a decision by which it fines EDF for having, from 2004 to 2021, improperly exploited the means at its disposal as an electricity supplier offering regulated electricity tariffs (TRV). It is alleged that EDF used the data from its customer files eligible for the TRV, as well as the commercial infrastructures dedicated to the management of the TRV contracts, in order to develop the marketing of gas market offers and energy services, and to convert a large part of its customers at the pivotal moment of the end of TRV for part of the professional customers. The objective pursued was to maintain its market share in the electricity supply sector and to strengthen its position in the related gas supply and energy services markets. EDF requested the benefit of the settlement procedure. As part of this negotiated procedure, the Autorité fined EDF 300 million euros. A procedure negociated with the Autorité As part of the investigation conducted by the Autorité, EDF requested the benefit of the settlement procedure. This procedure allows a company that does not contest the facts with which it is charged to obtain a financial penalty within a range negotiated with the General rapporteur, setting a maximum and minimum amount. EDF has also offered several commitments: on the one hand, to make available to alternative electricity suppliers who request it, its TRV Bleu customer file, on the other hand, to separate the telephone subscription paths of customers and prospects at TRV Bleu and customers and prospects in market offers. Taking into account all of these elements, the Autorité's board reduced the fine handed down to EDF and its subsidiaries to 300 million euros and made the proposed commitments binding for a period of three years, renewable.  Background of the gradual opening to competition of the electricity sector The practices implemented by EDF took place during the period when the sector was opening up to competition. This process began with Directive 96/92/EC and continued gradually, first for large companies and then for all consumers, professionals and individuals. Since 2007, all consumers in France, including residential (private individuals) are eligible for market offers. Some TRVs have gradually disappeared. Thus, the TRV Vert, intended for companies with very high consumption, and the TRV Jaune, intended for companies whose subscribed power was between 36 kVA and 250 kVA, disappeared on 1 January 2016. Only the TRV Bleu was kept for the private individuals.  The practice alleged against EDF It is alleged that EDF exploited the non-reproducible means at its disposal within the framework of its public service mission of supplying electricity to the TRV - respectively the customer files at the TRV and its commercial infrastructure dedicated to the activity at the TRV- to offer its customers at the TRV gas and electricity market offers, as well as additional services. It appears from the case file that EDF exploited its status as operator of TRV electricity in a logic of commercial conquest. In particular, in view of the disappearance of the TRV Jaune and Vert, EDF has used the commercial infrastructure dedicated to its activity of supplying electricity to the TRV, and in particular the data from its customer files at the TRV, in order to preserve its market share and to limit the development of its competitors. The use of this data also enabled EDF to detect customer needs in terms of the supply of gas and energy services and to offer them offers in addition to the supply of electricity. By using the human and technical resources associated with TRVs, which were not reproducible for its competitors, EDF benefited from a non-reproducible competitive advantage. The practices thus contributed to strengthening EDF's position in the energy sector as a whole and to delaying the development of alternative suppliers.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background The Autorité de la concurrence has fined Cofepp (Poliakov, Label 5, Cruz, Saint James, Old Nick, etc.) for acquiring control of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Marie Brizard, San José, William Peel, etc.) before notifying the Autorité of the transaction and without waiting for its clearance decision. In the present case, before requesting and obtaining the required clearance, Cofepp exercised a decisive influence on MBWS, in particular by appointing its new CEO, negotiating with its suppliers in place of MBWS's managers, directly participating in the establishment of MBWS's commercial and budgetary policy and intervening in several operational management decisions. Cofepp, which did not contest the practices, benefitted from a settlement procedure. The Autorité handed down a 7 million euros fine. Cofepp acquired control of MBWS before notifying the Autorité Cofepp undertook a gradual merger with MBWS starting in June 2015, gradually increasing its equity stake and by becoming, from 2017, its main shareholder. Cofepp had access to sensitive information relating to MBWS's commercial and budgetary policies through its representatives on the Board of Directors. It interfered in MBWS' strategic and operational decisions, even playing a key role in the selection of its new CEO. This de facto takeover of MBWS occurred even though the merger had not been notified to the Autorité , since it was not until 3 January 2019 that Cofepp filed its plan to acquire sole control of MBWS with the Autorité de la concurrence. Cofepp pursued its merger with MBWS before the Autorité had made its decision While Cofepp had gained decisive influence in the management of MBWS prior to the notification, it continued this premature merger between the notification and the Autorité's decision on 28 February 2019 [1] . The companies exchanged sensitive information in the context of the search for synergies between the two companies. Cofepp also gave certain instructions to the CEO and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of MBWS on various projects under consideration. Facts not contested by Cofepp The build-up of Cofepp's interference in the life of MBWS reflects a deliberate desire to carry out the transaction in defiance of the competition rules. The evidence in the file shows that Cofepp was fully aware of the obligations relating to the acquisition of sole control of MBWS, and disregarded them. Cofepp, which did not contest the facts, requested and obtained the benefit of a settlement procedure. In light of all these details, the Autorité imposed a €7 million fine on Cofepp.  [1] The Autorité cleared the transaction subject to brand transfers (see Decision 19-DCC-36 / press release ). What is the settlement? The settlement procedure allows a company that does not contest the charges brought against it to receive a financial penalty within a range proposed by the General Rapporteur and giving rise to the agreement of the parties.

        "full_text_press_realease": "The Autorité accepts Google's commitments to create a framework for negotiating and sharing the information necessary for a transparent assessment of the remuneration of related rights and makes these commitments binding Background Today, the Autorité de la concurrence issues a decision in which it accepts the commitments of Alphabet Inc, Google LLC, Google Ireland Ltd and Google France (hereinafter \"Google\") and closes the proceedings on the merits initiated in November 2019 by SEPM, APIG and AFP, which denounced practices implemented by Google following the adoption of Law No. 2019-775 of 24 July 2019 aimed at creating a related right for the benefit of press agencies and publishers (hereinafter, the \"Law on Related Rights\"). As a reminder, in April 2020, the Autorité issued injunctions in the context of urgent interim measures against Google ( Decision 20-MC 01 of 9 April 2020 /see press release ), pending the decision on the merits. It then enjoined the company to negotiate in good faith with press agencies and publishers for the remuneration due for the use of their protected content (inclusion of press photos and articles on the Google Search engine and its Google News and Discover services). In July 2021, it was then led to fine Google 500 million euros for non-compliance with these injunctions ( Decision 21-D-17 of 12 July 2021 / see press release ), enjoining Google to comply with its interim measures decision, subject to a periodic penalty payment. In the course of the investigation into the merits of this case, competition concerns were identified and formalised in a preliminary assessment. Following the communication of this assessment, Google proposed a first set of commitments in December 2021, which were subjected to a market test ( see press release of 15 December 2021 ). Following a hearing in April 2022 before the Board, Google successively sent four new versions of these commitments as well as a final proposal on 9 May 2022, in order to address both the concerns expressed in the market test and those of the Board. The Autorité considers that the commitments proposed by Google are likely to put an end to the competition concerns expressed and are substantial, credible and verifiable. It has therefore decided to accept them and make them binding. They will apply for a period of five years and be renewable once for a period of five years on a reasoned decision of the Autorité . Benoît Cœuré, President of the Autorité de la concurrence stated about today's decision: \" After issuing interim measures in April 2020 and then fining Google 500 million euros in July 2021 for non- compliance with these injunctions, the Autorité today welcomes the commitments taken by Google in the context of the procedure on the merits. The combination of these different means of action now makes it possible to create an environment offering more stability and guarantees of fairness for publishers and press agencies. For the first time in Europe, the commitments taken by Google provide a dynamic framework for negotiation and sharing of the information necessary for a transparent assessment of the remuneration of direct and indirect related rights. This framework will improve assessment methods and facilitate the transmission by Google of the information necessary for them. The commitments contain a complete system from the start of the negotiations to their conclusions, all under the supervision of a monitoring trustee, whose opinions will be binding on Google, and who may be assisted by experts in intellectual property, finance or press or publicity. They also include measures that will make it possible to find a solution in the event of a deadlock by the intervention of an arbitration court, the costs of which will be borne by Google.” Reminder of the reported practices and the previous procedural steps Considering serious and immediate damage to the press sector, in April 2020 the Autorité issued interim measures aimed at compelling Google to implement a good faith negotiation, in order to formulate a financial proposal for the use of the protected contents of press agencies and publishers ( 20-MC-01 ). Despite these injunctions, in a decision of non-compliance with the injunctions ( 21-D-17 of 12 July 2021 ), the Autorité found in July 2021 that Google had been able to frustrate negotiations with press agencies and publishers on the current use of protected press content on its services. In particular, it found that during almost the entire three-month negotiation period provided for in the interim measures decision, Google had systematically directed the negotiations towards the conclusion of a global licence agreement, whose subject matter was mainly a new service, called Showcase, based on the inclusion of full-text press articles that were previously not accessible on Google's portals. As a result of this behaviour, press agencies and publishers were deprived of their ability to negotiate specific remuneration for the current uses of their protected content during almost the entire negotiation period, even though they had clearly expressed this wish to Google on multiple occasions. that Google had significantly reduced the scope of application of the Law on related rights by excluding the principle of remuneration for press content from titles that do not have \"General and Political Information\" (or IPG) certification, and by refusing to allow news agencies to earn remuneration for their content reused by press publishers. \t and, lastly, that Google had adopted an excessively restrictive conception of the notion of revenues derived from the display of press content under Article L. 218-4 of the CPI, by only considering, as part of this basis, the advertising revenues of the Google Search pages on which protected content is displayed. In fact, Google excluded the indirect revenue that derives from the attractiveness provided to Google services through the display of protected content, both increases the amount of data it collects and improves its ability to deliver targeted advertising, and increases the likelihood that the user will access paid sponsored links on its online search site. Competition concerns In the course of the investigation into the merits of the case, the Investigation Services formalised several competition concerns relating to Google's behaviour in a \"preliminary assessment\" document. These concerns are based on three issues. \t Unfair trading conditions \t First, Google may have imposed unfair trading conditions on press agencies and publishers, constituting an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of European Union competition law (Article 102(a) of the TFEU and Article L. 420-2 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)), by refusing to negotiate and pay for the display of protected press content on Google's existing services under related rights.  \t Discriminatory treatment \t Secondly, by imposing zero remuneration for all press agencies and publishers when the Law on Related Rights entered into force, independently of an examination of their respective situations, Google is likely to have treated identically economic stakeholders placed in different situations without any objective justification, and, therefore, to have implemented a discriminatory practice constituting an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Articles L. 420-2 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and 102 (c) TFEU.   \t Circumvention of the law \t Lastly, Google may have abused its dominant position to circumvent the Law on Related Rights, in particular by using the possibility for news agencies and publishers to grant free licences to systematically impose a principle of non-remuneration for the display of protected content on its services, without any possibility of negotiation, and by refusing to communicate the information necessary for determining the remuneration. Google's commitments As a result of the preliminary assessment, Google submitted a set of commitments on 9 December 2021. These commitments were the subject of a market test and were discussed during a hearing before the Autorité . Following this hearing, Google released four successive versions of commitments, ultimately resulting in a substantially improved final proposal on 9 May 2022. Scope of application Google has extended the scope of application of its commitments to all publishers covered by Article L. 218-1 of the Intellectual Property Code (\"IPC\"), whether or not they have IPG certification. The same applies to related rights of press agencies that are integrated into third party publications and which are now expressly covered. Google also proposes extending the provisions of its commitments to press agencies and publishers that have already entered into negotiations or concluded a contract with Google for related rights, either directly or through a professional association. Press agencies and publishers with existing agreements will be able to amend or terminate those agreements at no cost to them so they can engage in new negotiations with Google, with the understanding that the compensation agreed to under their pre-existing agreements will continue to apply until the date of this amendment or termination. Good faith negotiation Google undertakes to \"negotiate in good faith\" with press publishers and news agencies that so request, the remuneration for any reproduction of protected content on its services in accordance with the modalities laid down in Article L.218-4 of the IPC and according to transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria. Google expressly agrees to conduct separate and independent negotiations regarding the Showcase service or any other new Google service, and regarding existing uses of protected content. Transmission of the information  necessary for the transparent evaluation of the remuneration Google undertakes to communicate the information necessary for a transparent evaluation of the proposed remuneration, as provided for in Article L.218-4 of the IPC. To this end, Google has planned to transmit, as a first step, a \"base\" of minimum information to each negotiating party within ten workdays for individual negotiations and 15 workdays for collective negotiations. This base includes the number of printings and click-through rates of protected content on Google Search, Google News and Google Discover, as well as data relating to Google's revenues in France, whether direct, indirect or resulting from its role as an intermediary in online advertising. As a second step, Google will provide the additional relevant information requested by press agencies and publishers within 15 workdays, under the supervision of an independent trustee. The trustee may issue an opinion, which will be binding on Google, on the technical feasibility or relevance of such requests. It will take measures to preserve the confidentiality of the information, where necessary. The most sensitive data (such as Google's Search ads and Display ads revenues in France) will only be shared with the trustee and its experts. This mechanism will reconcile Google's legitimate request to protect its business secrets with the need for press agencies and publishers to obtain the information necessary to assess Google's direct and indirect revenues from the display of their protected content. Neutrality of negotiations Google undertakes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the negotiations do not affect the crawling, ranking or presentation of the protected content and do not affect any other economic relationship that may exist between Google and the news agencies and press publishers; Withdrawal of the appeal against the decision for non-compliance with injunctions Google undertakes to withdraw its appeal against the decision on non-compliance with injunctions The fine of 500 million euros imposed by the Autorité on 12 July 2021 is therefore final. Arbitration procedure in the event of difficulties Google undertakes to make a proposal for remuneration within three months of the start of negotiations. In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement at the end of this negotiation period, the negotiating parties will have the option of referring the matter to an arbitration tribunal to determine the amount of remuneration. To take into account the limited financial resources of press agencies and publishers, they may, if they wish, ask Google to pay the arbitrators' fees in full, both for the first proceedings and for any appeal proceedings. Monitoring of commitments by an approved independent trustee An independent trustee approved by the Autorité will ensure the implementation of the commitments taken and may, if necessary, call on the services of a technical, financial or intellectual property expert. The trustee will oversee the negotiations between Google and the press agencies and publishers and will also be involved in the annual review and update of the minimum information that Google must provide to press agencies and publishers. The trustee will, where appropriate, play an active role in resolving any points of disagreement that arise between the parties in the course of their negotiations, by issuing opinions to the Autorité or making proposals on any dispute relating to the certification of a press publisher or agency, on whether a press publisher's domain contains protected content , on the technical feasibility or appropriateness of a request for additional information, and on the manner in which responses to requests for additional information should be communicated to press publishers and agencies. While the opinions and proposals are not binding on press agencies and publishers, Google has committed to comply with them. This mechanism provides a quick way to resolve disputes that, while binding on Google, preserve the freedom of press agencies and publishers to pursue their claims through other legal avenues if they see fit.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background For the record, the Autorité de la concurrence had cleared the takeover of SFR by the company Altice (at the time Numéricable) subject to structural and behavioural commitments in 2014. Subsequently, the Autorité fined Altice for not having implemented the commitments it had undertaken and handed out a 40 million euros fine along by several injunctions, some of which were subject to penalty payments in 2017. The Autorité today issues a decision in which it clears the penalty payments imposed in its 2017 decision and fines Altice for not having properly complied with the Autorité's injunctions within the deadline. Altice requested the benefit of the settlement procedure. As part of this negotiated procedure, the Autorité handed out a fine worth 75 million euros. This is the Autorité's first decision on the clearance of penalty payments on the basis of Article L. 430-8 of the Commercial Code. The decision to clear the takeover of SFR by Altice and the risks then identified with regard to the continued deployment of optical fibre The takeover of SFR by Altice was cleared by the Autorité de la concurrence in October 2014 ( decision 14-DCC-160 of 30 October 2014) subject to several commitments ( see the press release of 27 October 2014 ) to prevent identified risks of harm to competition. In particular, the Autorité considered that the transaction was likely to call into question the new entity's incentive to honour its contractual obligations in terms of fibre deployment, particularly vis-à-vis Bouygues Telecom. Indeed, Bouygues Telecom signed a co-investment agreement with SFR in November 2010, known as the “Faber contract”, relating to the deployment of a horizontal fibre optic network in 22 municipalities located in very dense areas. However, given the very high coverage rate of the cable network in very dense areas, SFR would have had little interest in continuing the deployment (most of the FttH sockets that SFR planned to deploy in very dense areas having become redundant with Numericable's cable network after the transaction). To remedy this competition issue, Altice had undertaken, on the one hand, to continue the development of fibre within the geographical scope of the Faber contract, by proceeding with the addition of concentration points within a constrained timetable, and on the other hand, to guarantee the maintenance of the network in a transparent and non-discriminatory way. In practice, the connection consists in installing cables (in purple in the diagram) making it possible to connect the so-called \"horizontal\" network to the so-called \"vertical\" network (shown in orange in the diagram) already installed in the building by the \"building operator”. From a technical point of view, the connection is done at the level of the \"concentration point\" of the building, generally located at the foot of the building, inside or outside of the latter according to the cases predefined by ARCEP.  The decision on non-compliance with the commitments made in 2017 In its 2017 decision ( 17-D-04 of 8 March 2017/ see press release ), the Autorité found that Altice had not complied with its commitments made in 2014 vis-à-vis Bouygues Telecom: the rhythm of the connections had slowed down considerably after the completion of the transaction, and had only really resumed after a year, generating a substantial delay in relation to the commitments made. In addition, this failure was accompanied by a deterioration in network maintenance conditions, which penalised Bouygues Telecom. The Autorité then handed out a 40 million euros fine, as well as several injunctions to ensure that Altice refrains from continuing these behaviours. In particular, it set Altice a new implementation schedule comprising stages of completion, some of which were accompanied by progressive penalties, in order to compel it to proceed with the supply of all concentration points which were not actually supplied. The Autorité also ordered Altice to respect the maintenance of the network covered by the Faber contract.  In this decision, the Autorité finds that Altice has not properly executed the injunctions and proceeds, for the first time, to a clearing of penalty payments The Autorité notes that despite \"the performance obligation\" incumbent on Altice, the company has not, within the deadline, complied with the injunctions. Thus, with regard to injunctions under penalty payments, the Autorité notes that the number of connections carried out by Altice remains very far from the levels of achievement that it had set in its decision. The Autorité also considers that, to a significant extent, the cases of non-performance were not linked to the external difficulties alleged by Altice and that in this respect the latter had not provided proof of a difficulty that had arisen which would not be attributable to him. With regard to the maintenance injunction, the Autorité considers that Altice has not achieved the objective assigned to it and this throughout the period considered, even though it notes an improvement over the last quarter. As part of the investigation led by the Autorité, Altice requested the benefit of the settlement procedure. This procedure allows a company that does not challenge the allegations brought against it to obtain a financial penalty within a range proposed by the General Rapporteur and agreed by the parties. Altice did not dispute the reality of these breaches and signed a settlement report on 11 May 2022. Given all of these elements, the Autorité fined Altice 75 million euros for the clearance of the penalty payments and the financial penalty imposed for non-compliance with certain injunctions. Finally, at Altice's request, the Autorité lifted the injunctions subject to penalty payments issued by decision 17-D-04 of 8 March 2017, considering that, for the future, their maintenance was not justified. It indeed noted that Altice has gradually approached, over the recent period, the objective set for it by the injunctions and that the number of concentration points remaining to be connected was henceforth residual. In addition, it notes in its decision that the Faber contract was the subject in 2018 of an amendment between the parties, which is inspired by the injunctions issued by the Autorité. Previous decisions 30 October 2014 ( Decision 14 DCC 160 / See the press release ): The Autorité cleared the exclusive acquisition of SFR by the Altice group, subject to structural and behavioural commitments \t 19 April 2016 ( Decision 16‑D‑07 / See the press release ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €15 million for failing to honour certain commitments related to the divestiture of the mobile telephone business of Outremer Telecom, pursuant to Decision 14-DCC-160. \t \t 8 November 2016 ( Decision no. 16-D-24 / See the press release ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €80 million for the premature completion of two transactions notified in 2014, including the transaction cleared by Decision 14-DCC-160. \t \t 8 March 2017 ( Decision 17‑D‑04 / See the press release ): The Autorité fined the Altice group €40 million for failing to honour its commitments related to the “Faber” agreement, pursuant to Decision 14-DCC-160. It also ordered several injunctions, including some with penalty payments. \t \t 28 October 2019 ( Decision 19-DCC-199 / See press release ): The Autorité de la concurrence does not renew the commitments undertaken by Altice when it acquired SFR. On the other hand, the injunctions subject to penalty payments issued by the Autorité in 2017 concerning the co-deployment agreement for the fibre optic network concluded with Bouygues Telecom (“Faber” agreement) are maintained. \t Decision 22-D-15 of 29 September 2022 See full text of the decision (in French) Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Referred to by the French Energy sectoral regulator, the Autorité de la concurrence has fined Gaz de Bordeaux for the fact that, between 2017 and 2019, it abused its dominant position in the sector of natural gas supply to residential and small non-residential customers in Bordeaux and the surrounding towns. Gaz de Bordeaux is accused of having abused its infrastructures and the commercial resources linked to its public service activity, in its capacity as a supplier of natural gas at the regulated sales tariff (RST), to develop its market offers (MO). Although it was obliged to continue marketing its regulated tariff offer, Gaz de Bordeaux withdrew this offer from its potential customers, systematically promoting its market offers, both on its website and through its telephone helpline. By artificially leading almost all its new customers to subscribe to a market offer, Gaz de Bordeaux reduced competition at a key moment in the opening up of the market to competition (disappearance of the regulated gas tariff). The Autorité jointly and severally imposed a financial penalty of one million euros on Gaz de Bordeaux and its parent companies (Régaz-Bordeaux and Bordeaux Métropole Energies) and required Gaz de Bordeaux to publish a summary of this decision on its website for three months. The gradual opening up of the natural gas supply business to competition All consumers in France, including (private) residential customers, have been eligible for market offers since 2007. Concurrent with this opening up to competition, the French Government has maintained the existence of regulated sales tariffs (RST). The opening up to competition, combined with the maintenance of the RST, allowed consumers to freely choose their supplier and select between: a regulated sales tariff contract, which was only offered by the incumbent suppliers, including Engie in most of France and Gaz de Bordeaux in the Bordeaux service area; a market offer contract, which is offered by both the incumbent operators and the new natural gas suppliers. In 2014, the Government established a timetable to phase out regulated sales tariffs. Recently, the Energy-Climate Law confirmed the end of the natural gas RST for small non-residential sites and for all residential consumers. In application of these provisions, the RST offer was abolished in December 2019 (impossible to subscribe to a new RST offer from this date), while customers who subscribed to an RST offer before this date have until 31 July 2023 (for residential customers) to subscribe to a new market offer with the supplier of their choice.  Gaz de Bordeaux's market position Formerly a monopoly before the opening up to competition, Gaz de Bordeaux is the incumbent retail natural gas supply operator for the city of Bordeaux and 45 surrounding towns in the Gironde département and is considered a local distribution company (LDC).  As the incumbent operator in this area, Gaz de Bordeaux has a monopoly on the marketing of gas supply offers at the RST by virtue of a public service mission, and can at the same time market MOs in competition with alternative operators. Despite the opening up to competition, the Autorité found that from 2016 to 2019, Gaz de Bordeaux's market share in the Bordeaux region was over 98%, giving it a quasi-monopoly in the Régaz-Bordeaux area (geographical area covered by the public service activity). More generally, the Autorité noted that the territories of the LDCs are lagging further behind the rest of France in terms of opening up to competition.  The alleged practice During the three years preceding the end of the RST, Gaz de Bordeaux used the technical and human resources resulting from its public service activity to systematically direct consumers towards market offers, deliberately not disclosing the existence of the RST offer. As an example, the RST offer gradually disappeared from the Gaz de Bordeaux website. The RST offer was demoted to the bottom of the page in 2017, and from 2019 was no longer available on the Gaz de Bordeaux website. At the same time, Gaz de Bordeaux's sales teams concealed its existence, thus leading almost all new customers to subscribe to market offers [1] . Therefore, by using the resources allocated by its public service activity, Gaz de Bordeaux created confusion between its public service activity and its competitive activity in a sector in which consumers were not well informed, and thus distorted the competitive functioning of the market. By redirecting consumers to market offers [2] , Gaz de Bordeaux also prevented many consumers from receiving clear information on the liberalisation of the gas market when the RSTs ended. Indeed, while the incumbent natural gas operators offering contracts at the RST were required to inform consumers by sending five regulatory letters informing them that the market was opening up to competition, this obligation did not exist for subscriptions to market offer contracts. Consumers guided by Gaz de Bordeaux towards MO contracts during the infringement period were therefore unable to receive the legal information and were deprived of the possibility of choosing an MO contract in a free and informed manner.  The sanctions imposed In view of all these elements, the Autorité de la concurrence imposes on Gaz de Bordeaux, jointly and severally with its parent companies, a fine of one million euros. The Autorité also orders Gaz de Bordeaux to publish a summary of this decision on its website for three months.  [1] The Autorité noted that 97% of new subscriptions between 1 January 2017 and 30 November 2019 involved MOs (compared to 0.10% in 2016). [2] In its referral, the French Energy Regulatory Commission noted that \"on the residential market in Régaz's service area, more than 16% of Gaz de Bordeaux's customers, previously on regulated sales tariffs, migrated to a Gaz de Bordeaux market offer between January 2017 and March 2018. During this period, approximately 2,000 customers per month subscribed to Gaz de Bordeaux's market offer. After March 2018, the movement was consistent over this period, at an identical pace.\"  Decision 22-D-17 of 11 October 2022 See full text of the decision (in French) Contact(s) Contact us by e-mail ",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Background Having received a complaint in October 2022 from the company Adloox SAS (hereinafter \"Adloox\") regarding practices implemented by the companies Meta Platforms Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. and Facebook France (hereinafter \"Meta\") in the online ad verification sector, the Autorité  de la concurrence (hereinafter \"the Autorité \") has today issued interim measures against Meta, pending a decision on the merits of the case. The Autorité considered that the conditions for accessing Meta's \"viewability\" and \"brand safety\" partnerships were likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position and cause serious and immediate harm both to Adloox's interests and to the independent ad verification sector. Consequently, the Autorité has ordered Meta to define and make public new criteria for accessing and maintaining \"viewability\" and \"brand safety\" partnerships which are objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate. It has also issued an injunction to allow Adloox to be rapidly admitted to these partnerships, provided that the company meets the new access criteria. The ad verification sector Ad verification refers to the processes in the online advertising sector which are intended to verify the quality of an ad inventory or an ad impression. It pursues three main objectives to ensure the quality of online advertising: viewability, which consists in checking that an ad has actually been seen by an Internet user; fraud detection, including invalid traffic from machines or robots; brand safety, which is intended to verify that the ad is not displayed in an environment which could harm the interests and values of the brand, and brand suitability, which is intended to verify that the ad is displayed in an environment which, according to the advertiser's own criteria, best matches the brand and its values. This type of services can be offered by integrated advertising platforms for their own ad inventories as well as by specialised independent operators who generally offer more accurate and granular measurements. In order to cover the inventories of integrated platforms, the independent verifiers need access to their ecosystems. Companies concerned Adloox is a French company that provides ad verification services on the Internet, specifically to advertisers and media agencies. Meta (formerly Facebook) is a multinational technology company specialising in Internet-related services and products, which it provides to Internet users, advertisers and developers. In the context of its advertising platform business, Meta also offers ad verification information and features on its own inventory (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger) and Meta Audience Network. Meta has created two partnerships relating to independent third-party ad verification services: one for viewability (in 2015), and a second for brand safety and brand suitability (in 2019). In the context of these partnerships, for which access is by invitation only, Meta collects, processes and provides data to its partners so that they can offer their verification services on its inventories (in particular on Facebook and Instagram). Three viewability partners (DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Oracle MOAT) and three brand safety partners (DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Zefr) offer ad verification services on Meta's advertising inventories. Since 2021, these partnerships are part of the Meta Business Partners programme. Practices contested by Adloox From 2016 and until 2022, Adloox requested, directly or indirectly through its clients, to have access, similarly to some of its competitors, to Meta's ecosystem, with the aim of providing its independent ad verification services on Meta's inventories.  Adloox claims that Meta discriminatorily denied it access to its viewability and brand safety partnerships, even though it was in a similar situation to other companies that had access to these partnerships. Furthermore, Adloox believes that Meta is abusing its dominant position, by imposing unfair access conditions and only granting partial access to its ecosystem. Adloox's final request, in August 2022, received no response from Meta. In this context, in parallel to its complaint on the merits of the case, Adloox has requested interim measures, intended in particular to order Meta to include it in these partnerships. The Autorité considers that Meta's practices are likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position Moreover, the Autorité considers that Meta has implemented various practices that could constitute an abuse of dominant position: firstly, Meta has not defined transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria for accessing and maintaining viewability and brand safety partnerships, and admitted its current partners to the partnerships following an opaque procedure which only it could initiate. Meta's approach is therefore inconsistent with its specific responsibility as the dominant operator and regulator of the independent ad verification market on a platform that accounts for a substantial portion of advertisers' ad spend. Although, in the context of the investigation, Meta provided the Autorité with new \" eligibility criteria \" for these partnerships in January 2023, these were not made public and are still intended to be implemented in the context of an invitation system. Moreover, at this stage, these criteria seem both disproportionate and unjustified; secondly, the refusal to grant Adloox access to the partnerships is likely to be qualified as discriminatory , as Adloox is in a situation comparable to that of certain operators who were able to access these partnerships, with regard to the conditions allegedly applied by Meta. Furthermore, the exchanges between Meta and Adloox reveal that Meta never intended to integrate Adloox, and several exchanges appear to be purely delaying tactics. Article L. 464-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) provides that the Autorité may issue interim measures when it considers that practices cause serious and immediate harm \" to the general economy, to the sector concerned, to the interests of consumers or, where applicable, to the complainant company \". In this case, the Autorité considered that Meta's practices cause: serious and immediate harm to the independent ad verification sector , insofar as they result in the oligopolistic structure of the market becoming more entrenched. Indeed, access to Meta's ecosystem is crucial for independent ad verifiers, given the large-scale investment of advertisers in its inventories, but also the growing demand from their clients for a single offering which covers all online advertising channels. By creating artificial barriers to entry and expansion, such practices significantly hinder the development of the ad verification sector and the incentives to innovate. The extent of these practices is all the more serious as they are implemented in the context of the forthcoming opening up of the independent ad verification market. Indeed, the European legislator has laid down, in the Digital Markets Act (Regulation 2022/1925 of 14 September 2022), the obligation for the main advertising platforms to provide free access to all the data necessary for the independent verification of their ad inventories; serious and immediate harm to the interests of Adloox , whose inability to provide its verification services on Meta deprives it of an important growth driver and is likely to result in the loss of its current clients. It should also be noted that Adloox's business has declined significantly since 2017, concomitantly with Meta's refusal to admit it to its ecosystem, while the business of its competitors admitted to the ecosystem has grown significantly. The refusal of access to Adloox could therefore lead, before the end of the investigation into the merits of the case, to its foreclosure from the ad verification market. Interim measures issued Given the potentially anticompetitive nature of the reported practices as well as the harm caused to the ad verification sector and to Adloox's interests, the Autorité has ordered Meta, first, to suspend the criteria implemented in January 2023 and, second, to define and make public, via the website of the MBP programme \"Measurement\" (https://www.facebook.com/fbp/measurement), within two months, new criteria for accessing and maintaining \"viewability\" and \"brand safety\" partnerships which are objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate. Meta will have to implement the criteria in the context of a transparent access procedure which is not based on invitation. The Autorité has also issued interim measures to accelerate the process of admitting Adloox into these partnerships in the event that its application for access, examined on the basis of the new criteria to be adopted by Meta, is accepted. These interim measures will remain in effect until the Autorité issues its decision on the merits of the case. During this period, and in order to ensure the effectiveness of these interim measures, Meta will have to send the Autorité regular reports on the implementation of the injunctions issued.

        "full_text_press_realease": "Cloud computing: the Autorité de la concurrence issues its market study on competition in the cloud sector On 27 January 2022, the Autorité de la concurrence  announced that it had started proceedings ex-officio to issue a market study on competition conditions in the cloud computing sector. The Autorité is today issuing its final opinion, after publishing an interim document in the summer of 2022 and consulting all the stakeholders. The cloud is one of the technological developments that is central to the digitisation of the economy. It is a source of productivity gains for companies and value creation for the economy. In this opinion, the Autorité focuses particularly on cloud layers relating to IT infrastructure (IaaS, « Infrastructure-as-a-Service ») and platform services  (PaaS, « Platform-as-a-Service ») for business clients. Developments also concern the entire cloud value chain (among which layers relating to software services (SaaS, « Software-as-a-service ») when it is relevant to the competitive analysis. The sector is dominated by three hyperscalers: Amazon Web Services (AWS) , Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, and represent 80% of the spending growth in public cloud infrastructures and applications in France in 2021 . Amazon and Microsoft have captured 46 % and 17 % respectively of revenues from IaaS and PaaS services in 2021. Given their financial capacities and their digital ecosystems, these hyperscalers are in a position to hinder competition development. The Autorité proposes an analysis grid presenting possible relevant markets in the cloud sector and analyzes various practices implemented or likely to be implemented in this sector, which could restrict competition. Certain risks impact overall competition in the sector for instance, cloud credits or egress fees. Others fit into specific scenarios, with risks for businesses when migrating to the cloud for the first time, when building their IT systems directly from the cloud, and when migrating a cloud service provider to another. The Autorité also examines risks linked to the barriers to expansion for hyperscalers' competitors. To tackle these risks, the Autorité points out that it has tools to act swiftly and effectively and protect competition on various grounds such as abuse of dominant position law, cartel law, abuse of economic dependence and merger control. The French law on restrictive competition practices can also be an appropriate response to certain situations. Further, the Autorité identifies market failures likely to be addressed by the regulations under discussion such as the European (« Data Act ») or the French Governement's draft law to secure and regulate the digital space. Finally, the Autorité observes that, in the future, several evolutions will potentially have an impact on competition in the sector. Large language models (LLM, such as ChatGPT), edge computing, cloud gaming , cybersecurity issues or the growing importance of its environmental footprint can be mentioned, among others. Competition authorities will have to monitor that established players do not hinder the development of smaller or new players based on these technologies.

In 1993, the Coordination rurale du Lot-et-Garonne (Lot-et-Garonne Rural Co-ordination Organisation) had exerted pressure on fruit and vegetable traders, in an effort to deter them from acquiring supplies of strawberries from Spain. It had organised boycott action against imports of Spanish strawberries, by carrying out checks on merchandise in warehouses and shops, and by threatening to destroy merchandise. It had also circulated letters addressed to distributors, in which it fixed a minimum retail price for French strawberries, and pressure was exerted on distributors who chose not to respect the price directives. These initiatives took place within a context characterised by violent action taken against Spanish imports and several shops. In its decision, the Conseil observed that the actions undertaken by the Coordination rurale, during the crucial period when the price of French strawberries is much higher than that of strawberries imported from Spain, had the principal result of obstructing the free determination of prices for a consumer product by market forces. The Conseil found that by imposing retail prices and boycotting imports, the Coordination rurale du Lot-et-Garonne had obstructed price drops, prevented other companies from accessing the market and acutely restricted trade between Member States of the European Union. Consequently, the Conseil fined the organisation a total of 150,000 FF. > Decision n° 00-D-01 relative to practices implemented in the sector for fruits and vegetables > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (17th October 2000)",

        "full_text_press_realease": " In a decision dated 19th September 2000, the Conseil de la concurrence penalised several major banks and credit establishments, which it found guilty of implementing an anticompetitive agreement in the sector for property loans to private individuals in 1993 and 1994. It is the first time that the Conseil de la concurrence has dealt with anticompetitive practices in the banking sector. In the early 1980s, long-term mortgage rates peaked at 20%, before dropping sharply within a few financial quarters from 1985, stabilising at around 12% in late 1992, when they registered another substantial drop until 1994. They then reached a level of between 7.5 and 9%. During periods of falling rates, when the difference between the rates practised for new property loans and the rates practised in the previous period reaches around 2%, there is an advantage for holders of loans with over five/seven years still to run either to renegotiate their loan conditions with their bank, or to profit from competition between banks by paying off their loan early and renegotiating a new loan with a new lender. This last option is expressly stipulated by article L. 312-21 of the code de la consommation . The Conseil de la concurrence found that, faced with this situation, the main investment establishments had reached an “inter-bank non-aggression pact”, under which each of them refrained from making offers to customers of other banks who wished to renegotiate their property loans. Besides aiming to prevent competition between banks, this agreement enabled each of them to better resist requests by their own customers to renegotiate their loans, since the customers in question were subsequently unable to turn to another bank in the event of their request being refused. Such concerted action between the main players in a market, aimed at distorting price competition, is prohibited by the Ordinance of 1st December 1986 relative to price freedom and competition. In addition, it constitutes an anticompetitive practice that is viewed as particularly serious by all competition authorities. The Conseil de la concurrence , which had assumed jurisdiction on its own initiative, indicated that whilst banking activities are governed by specific regulation, like all other service activities, whether regulated or not, they are still subject to competition law. The Conseil also indicated that the competitive workings of the market are based on the independence and autonomy of the players involved. It stated that when concertation practices lead to the removal of any uncertainty they effectively distort competition, since each establishment is assured that the other banking networks will apply the same commercial policy. The Conseil noted that, even if a cartel agreement between banks was not applied in a uniform manner, borrowers were deprived of the option of significantly reducing their property debts, whereas property represents the most substantial investment by households, and the repayment of loans required for this investment accounts for 30% of their disposable income. According to the banking establishments, the outstanding amounts likely to be affected by the renegotiation of property loans during the period in question totalled approximately 600 billion FF. However, households were only able to renegotiate around 36 billion FF, which for them represented an overall reduction in interest charges of 3 billion FF over ten years. Given the seriousness of the practice and the national scope of the agreement implemented by the main property loans operators, the Conseil imposed fines totalling more than one billion Francs: 450 million FF on the Caisse nationale de Crédit agricole ; 250 million FF on Banque nationale de Paris ; 250 million FF on Société Générale , 100 million FF on Crédit lyonnais , 70 million FF on the Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Épargne et de Prévoyance , 10 million FF on the Confédération nationale du Crédit mutuel , 8 million FF on the Caisse d'épargne des Alpes , 6 million FF on the Caisse régionale du Crédit agricole de Loire-Atlantique and 500,000 FF on the Fédération du Crédit mutuel Océan . > Decision n° 00-D-28 relative to the competition situation in the property loans sector > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (27th November 2001) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 23th June 2004",

The Conseil fined these companies a total of 17,700,000 FF (2,698,347 Euros). The Conseil observed that : From 1988 and until 1994, the producer Dijon Béton and the 3 traders Doras Matériaux, Pagot et Savoie and Bloc Matériaux implemented a joint tariff structure concerning margins applicable to the sales price of ready-to-use concrete. The producer Maggioni also entered into an agreement with these same traders, with two results : firstly the traders practised a minimum margin of 10% on sales of its products; secondly (in 1993) they applied the tariff system devised between Maggioni and Dijon Béton to the former's products. In September 1993, the two producers Dijon Béton and Maggioni, with the consent of the traders, entered into a market sharing agreement. According to the terms of this agreement, Maggioni was guaranteed a share of 17% of the ready-to-use concrete market in the Dijon region. This market sharing agreement was accompanied by a system of monthly checks, to ensure that the commitments undertaken were respected, and to have wholesalers allocate Maggioni customers to Dijon Béton whenever Maggioni exceeded its quota. The Conseil emphasised that market sharing and price agreements seriously impair competition and referred to the 1998 OECD Recommendation, which indicates that such agreements are unjustifiable and “constitute the most flagrant breach of competition law”. It ordered its decision to be published in the newspaper Le Progrès, “so that potential users of ready-to-use concrete are informed of the practices with which they may be faced”. It imposed fines of 1,900,000 FF (289,653 Euros) on Dijon Béton, 1,000,000 FF (155,449 Euros) on Maggioni, 5,700,000 FF ( 868,958 Euros) on Doras Matériaux, 7,400,000 FF (1,128,122 Euros) on Pagot et Savoie, and 1,700,000 FF ( 259,163 Euros) on Bloc Matériaux.",

        "full_text_press_realease": "In a decision dated 19th July 2001, following a referral by the company Casino France, the Conseil de la concurrence found that the company Bausch & Lomb had breached the provisions of Article L. 420-1 of the Code of Commercial Law, by imposing sales prices for Ray-Ban sun products on its network during the period 1995-1998. The Conseil fined Bausch & Lomb a total of 500,000 FF for this practice. From 1995 onwards, the company Bausch & Lomb had introduced a selective distribution policy for Ray-Ban products, which was intended to maintain the brand's image and prestige. The selective distribution contracts contained provisions for selecting distributors (professional qualification, after-sales service and street shop window required, sales outlet evaluations), as well as tariff policy measures (highly specific promotional policy, systematic discounts forbidden). In this case, which raised issues concerning national law only, the Conseil based its deliberations on principles adopted by the European Commission in its vertical restrictions Regulation of 22nd December 1999. According to these principles, certain clauses linking suppliers to their distributors are likely to affect competition and thus remain prohibited, even where the market share of the company concerned is below 30%. This is the case of practices whereby prices are imposed by suppliers. On this basis, it was found that the company Bausch & Lomb used certain contractual clauses in the aim of preventing distributors from practising prices lower than those recommended and organising their promotions freely. To achieve this, Bausch & Lomb exerted various forms of pressure on the distributors (threats, warnings, penalties, late or suspended deliveries, surveillance of promotional activities). This practice, which had the aim and the effect of obstructing the play of competition by prices for distributors located in the same trading area, constitutes an illegal price practice that justifies penalties. On the other hand, the Conseil took the view that, given that Bausch & Lomb held only 25% of the French sunglasses market, the other clauses implicated, concerning the selection of distributors, had no anticompetitive aim or effect. In particular, the Conseil found that they were not intended to strengthen the policy of controlling the prices practised in relation to distributors. This decision demonstrated the Conseil 's concern with integrating further the lessons of economic analysis into the anticompetitive nature of the practices referred to it.",

Exclusive broadcasting rights obtained by RMC Info On 4th December 2001, the company RMC Info signed a contract with the company Kirchmedia, which held exclusive radio broadcasting rights to matches of the 2002 football World Cup through an agreement with IFA (International Football Association). The said contract gave RMC Info exclusive rights to broadcast the matches in France, and included an obligation to seek to cover the entirety of the French national territory. Since RMC Info's broadcasting zones only cover half of the French population, the company sought to reach sub-licence agreements with other radio stations. In the name of pluralism and the principle of freedom of information, on 17th December 2001 the main general interest radio stations set up an Economic Interest Group called GIE Sport libre, to which they had granted exclusivity in their policy for purchasing sporting rights. RMC Info and the Economic Interest Group did not succeed in reaching a sub-licence agreement. Since it was unable to negotiate individually with the members of the group (since the rules applied within it prohibited its members from entering into individual negotiations), and with the World Cup tournament approaching, RMC Info asked the Conseil de la concurrence to take emergency measures against the group. The problem of selling radio broadcasting rights GIE Sport Libre revealed that the companies responsible for creating it were opposed to the very principle of exclusive radio broadcasting rights for sporting events. The Conseil took the view that it has no place to rule on the legitimacy of selling exclusive radio broadcasting rights. However, referring to the opinion issued by the CSA (Broadcasting Regulator) which indicates that “the acquisition of exclusive rights for broadcasting sporting events over the radio is not prohibited by any legislative or regulatory measure in force”, the Conseil concluded that there was nothing to prevent it from examining RMC Info's referral. The practice by which several companies combine their purchasing policy is not prohibited in itself, but it can often pose competition problems that justify a full inquiry into the case. The need for an interim measure In light of the calendar of the World Cup and the fact that this situation could potentially deprive listeners (in the part of France not covered by RMC) of the ability to hear broadcasts of football World Cup matches, the Conseil de la concurrence took the view that there was a serious and immediate risk of damage to consumer-listeners' interests. Consequently, the Conseil de la concurrence ordered GIE Sport libre to suspend certain clauses in its articles of association and internal rules, which strictly limited the ability of its members to negotiate or sign any individual agreements relating to broadcasting of sporting events, specifically for radio broadcasts of the football World Cup matches. This procedure is not intended as a substitute for a full inquiry into the case on the merits, which will be conducted at a later date and will result in a new decision. > Decision n° 02-MC-06 of 30th April 2002, relative to the referral and request for interim measures filed by the company RMC Info > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, 4th June 2002.

        "full_text_press_realease": " Following a referral by the Minister of Economy, in a decision dated 14th June 2002, the Conseil de la concurrence penalised an anticompetitive agreement between 35 opticians based in Lyons. These opticians had organised a boycott of the companies supplying one of their competitors, who was practising discounts on the price of spectacle frames. The Conseil imposed fines on the opticians and on one supplier who had taken part in their actions. The fines handed down totalled 2,046,894 Euros. This is the first time that the Conseil de la concurrence has penalised such an extensive anticompetitive agreement in the Lyons region, involving so many companies. The Conseil emphasises that competition enables consumers to benefit from lower prices and thus protects their purchasing power. The collective boycott implemented by a large number of opticians in the Lyons area constituted a particularly serious practice, insofar as it prevented consumers from taking advantage of substantial discounts on a product that is essential in daily life. The opening of the Optical Center in 1996 creates upheaval in the market At the end of September 1996, an optical store called “Optical Center” opened its doors in the centre of Lyons. It implemented an aggressive sales policy based on substantial discounts – up to 40% - on spectacle frames (including those made by prestigious brands), supported by a marketing and advertising campaign focusing on the low prices. Opticians in Lyons mobilise against Optical Center's discount policy In response to this campaign and on the initiative of four opticians based in the centre of Lyons (the companies Bourdeau, Nagabbo, Chavril and Europtic), around forty opticians in the Lyons region held a meeting to agree on retaliatory measures to be taken against the manufacturers of frames on sale in the Optical Center store. Their common aim was to encourage the said manufacturers to cease deliveries to this outlet, and to organise a boycott in the event that they should refuse to comply. In practice, these retaliatory measures took the form of letters, telephone conversations and pressure exerted on the representatives of the suppliers concerned. In a number of cases, they took the form of commercial measures (reduction, suspension or cancellation of orders, withdrawal of products from display windows, termination of commercial relations) aimed at the companies supplying Optical Center. The manufacturer L'Amy joins the boycott movement Yielding to this pressure, the manufacturer L'Amy (which markets the brands Lacoste and Nina Ricci in particular) joined the movement to persuade Optical Center to alter its sales policy and withdraw its low price policy. After taking various retaliatory measures (with some extended to all Optical Center outlets in France), it finally unilaterally broke off all commercial relations with Optical Center Lyon. In addition to the fines imposed, the Conseil ordered a part of its decision to be published in the regional daily newspaper Le Progrès and in the specialist magazine Vente Optique.",

        "full_text_press_realease": " In a decision dated 28th June 2002, the Conseil de la concurrence fined the electrical appliances manufacturer Thomson and the distributors Fnac, Darty, Euromarché, Connexion, Camif and Conforama a total of 34,160,000 Euros (224 million Francs). Although the company Akaï actively participated in the practices penalised, the Conseil did not impose fines upon it as it has been ordered into liquidation. The brands Akaï and Thomson are among the highest sellers in France for VCRs, video cameras and television sets. Akaï products at the same price in most outlets… After a wide-ranging inquiry involving numerous price analyses, it was established that the distributors accused were practising identical (or very close) prices for each Akaï brand reference. The Conseil de la concurrence found that this price alignment was the result of a series of vertical agreements on retail sales prices in stores, between Akaï and the five distributors Fnac, Darty, Euromarché, Connexion and Conforama. This price alignment, which had been introduced during commercial negotiations between Akaï and its distributors, was then consolidated by the commercial and marketing policy they implemented : The uniformity of prices was controlled both by the manufacturer, via its sales forces, and by the distributors themselves, via the clause stating that if a customer can purchase the same product from another store at a lower price, then the distributor will refund the difference. In fact, this clause meant that consumers spotted any distributors who failed to respect the agreed price ; The issue of catalogues and of national or local advertising also enabled the distributors to ensure that the prices agreed were widely respected across the country. Thomson “negotiated” the sales prices of its products to the Camif catalogue The inquiry and the investigation also revealed that the sales prices of products made by the Thomson group (brands Thomson, Brandt, Saba, Telefunken) and sold by Camif to its members, had been fixed at an agreed level during commercial negotiations between the two parties, well before the mail order catalogue was printed and distributed. The end consumer : a victim of these practices This series of agreements between Akaï and its distributors ultimately led to a standardisation in sales prices to consumers. They enabled Akaï and its distributors to guarantee their margins and penalised the end consumer, by making it impossible for competition to apply through prices practised by distributors for the same product. Similarly, common price fixing between the manufacturer Thomson and Camif potentially deprived the consumer of the possibility of taking advantage of lower prices. Serious practices, the scope of which justifies fines Price agreements are among the most serious anticompetitive practices, and are systematically identified and penalised by competition authorities. In this particular case, the practices concerned are all the more serious in that the companies accused are major players in the market : Along with the company Philips, Akaï (specialist in so-called “brown” goods, i.e. radio, television and video equipment) occupies the number one spot in sales of video cassette recorders. Among the distributors, the Pinault-Printemps-La Redoute group (which owns Fnac and Conforama) is the leader in the “ specialist ” distribution segment, followed by Darty. The company Euromarché (Carrefour group) is leader in the segment for distribution via the network of hypermarkets selling mainly food products. Along with the company Philips, Thomson occupies the number one spot in sales of television sets. The Camif group is the third largest mail order distributor. The Conseil  indicated that where such large distributors participate in agreements of this kind, it could lead other independent distributors and suppliers to believe that this type of behaviour is normal, and encourage them to adopt it. It therefore considered that the damage caused to the economy went beyond the stakes of the brands and distributors concerned : the penalties imposed take account of these elements, but also the duration and the scope of the practices as well as the respective turnovers of the companies accused. The Conseil also took into consideration the fact that this is a repetition of practices for the companies Thomson, Darty and Conforama, which had already been found guilty of similar practices in 1980. > Decision n° 02-D42 relative to practices in the sector for distribution of electrical appliances and consumer electronics > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (4th July 2003)",

        "full_text_press_realease": "Version Française  The Conseil de la Concurrence has sentenced the main manufacturers of ball bearings on the French market for having enforced a cartel agreement. The Conseil de la Concurrence pronounced, for this practice referred by the French Minister of Economy, penalties of 19 014 000 euro (decision of September 19, 2002). Agreement on gross prices and on granted rates of rebate The Conseil de la Concurrence established that in 1993 and 1997, the Swedish company SKF, the French company SNR, and the German companies FAG and INA had closed links and agreed both on the level of increases in gross prices and on the rates of price rebate applied to distributors. Besides, the Conseil de la Concurrence also raised that, in 1993, the Japanese companies, Koyo and NSK, had agreed, with some of the above companies, on the level of price increases to be applied to several industrial customers. The Conseil de la Concurrence underlined that such exchanges of information on evolutions of gross prices and rates of rebate, before these are announced and become actual, can favour artificial price increases. Indeed, the concerned companies are urged to proceed to such increases all the more as they are sure that their competitors will also increase their prices at the same moment. The instruction also showed that distributors could not benefit from the technical aid of manufacturers when they supplied customers situated outside the agreed zone. The Conseil de la Concurrence considered that such a practice could hinder competition among distributors and, also, consolidate price agreements between manufacturers. Serious practices that justify substantial financial penalties These behaviours constitute the most obvious violation of competition's law and are particularly reprehensible as far as: they were repeated and covered a number of years, they concern ball bearings, indispensable material to the functioning of any mechanical machine and used in numerous branches of the economic activity. They have been implemented by ball bearings companies, sales of which on the French market accounted for nearly ¾ from the total of sales in 1998, they resulted in an artificial increase in gross prices of the sector: the increase in gross prices, announced by the manufacturers participating in the agreement (that is 3 % by the end of 1993, 4.5 % in the middle of 1994, 4.5 % at the beginning of 1995 and 3.5 % at the beginning of 1998), led to an accumulated increase of 16.4 % over the whole period. Even if gross prices are traditionally the subject of important rebates, these agreements could have an effect on the practised net prices, especially since rebates made also the subject of agreement.

        "full_text_press_realease": " In a decision dated 11th July 2002, the Conseil de la concurrence , which had assumed jurisdiction at its own initiative, established that the companies Compagnie générale des eaux (CGE) and Lyonnaise des eaux (SLDE) hold a collective dominant position in the markets for water and purification, and that they have abused that position. For the first time, the Conseil applied article L. 430-9 of the French Code of Commercial Law, asking the Minister of Economy to conduct a review, if necessary dismantling the joint subsidiaries that the companies in question had set up together. The markets for water distribution and purification are dominated by two major groups : CGE and SLDE The markets for water distribution and purification are highly concentrated. CGE and SLDE together hold around 85% of these markets, and these two groups have set up joint ventures in several regions. The Conseil took the view that CGE and SLDE hold a collective dominant position in the markets for water distribution and purification, based on the following factors : The size of their respective market shares ; The existence of structural links between them ; The very nature of the market (which is relatively closed to competition) and the characteristics of the product (homogeneity and weak price elasticity), which are likely to encourage collusive behaviour. Competition distorted during public calls for tender During several public calls for tender launched by local and regional administrations from June 1997 onwards, the parent companies abstained from making bids. By refraining from responding to the calls for tender, and thereby avoiding entering into competition with their joint subsidiaries, the companies CGE and SLDE restricted competition. The Conseil took the view that in doing so, they had abused their collective dominant position, since a company or group of companies in a dominant position has a “ special responsibility to avoid behaving in such a way as to harm effective competition in the market ”. Joint subsidiaries called into question Invoking article L. 430-9 of the French Code of Commercial Law for the first time, the Conseil asked the Minister of Economy to order the companies Compagnie générale des eaux and Lyonnaise des eaux to \" modify, complete or cancel, within a stipulated period, all agreements and deeds by which these companies associated their resources in joint subsidiaries, which they set up together in the drinking water and purification sectors ”. The Minister of Economy will thus have the task of conducting a case-by-case analysis, to determine whether there are grounds for dismantling these joint subsidiaries. The Conseil decided that there were no grounds for imposing fines on the companies CGE and SLDE, taking into consideration the fact that the authorities responsible for monitoring mergers had not issued any prior reservations concerning the creation of the joint subsidiaries. The Conseil also took into consideration the fact that the said subsidiaries had often been created to satisfy demands by local and regional administrations, rather than at the behest of the parent companies. In pronouncing this decision, the Conseil was seeking not to act in a repressive manner, but rather to act within its regulatory role with the aim of influencing the market structure and thereby correcting the source of the observed dysfunctions. > Decision n° 02-D-44 relative to the state of competition in the sectors for drinking water and purification, notably concerning the pooling of resources in order to respond to calls for tender > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (18 February 2003) > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 12nd july 2004 ",

Price information repeatedly and frequently exchanged between motorway service station operators : a collective anticompetitive action  During the inquiry, declarations made by service station operators revealed that at the behest or with the consent of their respective oil companies, several times each week the service stations exchanged information by telephone on the prices charged for different types of fuel. The same day, this information was then systematically passed on to the head offices of the oil companies. They then determined the prices they asked their station operators to apply based on their competitors' prices. The Conseil took the view that these practices had necessarily caused prices to converge rapidly at a higher level than that which would have applied if the oil companies had conducted independent pricing policies. Any attempt by a company to lower its prices was futile, since its competitors were quickly informed by the service station of the company initiating the price change. This meant that they were able to react to the proposed price change immediately, thereby eliminating the potential benefits of the operation for the first company. In this respect, the Conseil notes that, in its decisions concerning Exxon/Mobil and TotalFina/Elf, the European Commission identified \"a difference of between 25 and 30% in pre-tax prices between motorway service stations and non-motorway stations\". The Commission specified \"that this price difference was the largest observed in any EU country, and does not reflect the costs borne by motorway service stations, which are in fact among the lowest in the entire EU\". Seriousness of the practices and damage to the economy  The Conseil de la concurrence emphasised that these practices are particularly serious, in that : they were carried out within an oligopolistic market, where increased transparency results in less intense competition ; consumers of fuel on motorways are \"captive\", and the companies accused took advantage of this fact to determine their behaviour ; the practices concerned were widespread and, as has been admitted by service station managers who were questioned, they have been carried out \"for some years\". Finally, the Conseil de la concurrence underlined that almost 7 million motorists use the motorway network each year. Breakdown of sanctions  TotalFinaElf France : 12 million Euros ; Esso SAF : 5 million Euros ; Shell : 5 million Euros ; BP France : 5 million Euros. > Decision n° 03-D-17 dated 31st March 2003, relative to practices in the motorway fuel distribution market > See decision of the Paris Court of Appeal (9th December 2003). > See decision of the Cour de cassation (Supreme Court of Appeals) - 25th January 2005.",
